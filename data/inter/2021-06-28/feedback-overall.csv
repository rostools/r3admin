2021-06-30,"Thank all you so much: I love the course and all of you were so professional, friendly and helpful"
2021-06-30,Very nice course! I could use less time working with my own data. Only the ones with their own data available seems to get something out of it and got a lot of help. I was just awaiting a lot...
2021-06-30,Overall it would be really nice with more mandatory/optional exercise so you do not spent as long a time waiting. Then everybody can catch up during instructor's walk through.
2021-06-30,"I personally prefer to have things explained by someone rather than reading them. Although, it's nice to have a little reading if the topic is explained afterwards,  it is much nicer to listen to someone who can explain with good examples. So perhaps elaborate even further with more examples :)  Thank you for a great course!"
2021-06-30,"It was a great course! A lot of useful material and good explanations. The teachers are amazing! Thanks a million! It's super nice to have all materials available online, to have a look during the course and also after and to advise to others. Sometimes, I lost track a little bit but I guess, it's ok for the new information and it was nice to have everything online. Also the idea with stickers is great, nice to feel, that teachers keep track that everybody is doing things together. Thanks again!"
2021-06-30,"Very very nice course. I was impressed with the course material and how structured the course and instructors were. Also good and inspirational talk about ""Whats next?"". Thank you guys!"
2021-06-30,"I was too much of an amateur before the course, so it was difficult"
2021-06-30,"The teaching speed could be a faster. It is understandable that we are a big mix of experienced and new coders. As an experienced the pace could be higher. Though, the slow pace gave me time to try out the new stuff on my own old code, which was really great. Thanks for a good course!"
2021-06-30,"Really really like the enthusiasm and the knowledge of the instructors, would go to any other course organized by this group! i hope to see some advanced R courses, git courses, working on cluster courses and many others :) thank you for a great experience!"
2021-06-30,I loved the course by from my own perspectives I would have liked more focus on data analysis/processing than the whole import aspect
2021-06-30,It is a great course.
2021-06-30,I think it would be nice to sit in groups all the days -makes it easier to help one another
