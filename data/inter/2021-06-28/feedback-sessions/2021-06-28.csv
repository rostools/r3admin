Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",I think maybe we don't need to repeat our work for all of the import functions. I think doing one of them is enough,NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Generally it worked really great with code-along, and then performing very similar exercises - allowed to really try out and understand what was taught. Also, really happy with the course material and structure so far.",NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Very minor comment, but I think sometimes it was difficult to understand why is it of benefit to use some specific functions within the vroom package (import data -> spec -> specify the columns again).",NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","Very much the same regarding code-along + exercises. Also, simple, but really great explanation of functions - even though I have used functions before, now it seems much more intuitive and I am really excited to use them in my own script !",NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",Everything was really well put in this session - I cannot put my finger on anything specific :),NA
