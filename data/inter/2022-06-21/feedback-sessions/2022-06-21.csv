Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","I think sometimes it's quite stressful (applies to all sessions) when we are told to read something in e.g. ""10 minutes"", it actually makes me have to read things over again and taking longer because I feel stressed to read it in time and thus miss things"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",I think the content could have been covered in less time.
