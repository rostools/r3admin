Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,It was easy to follow instructions,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,I don't know,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,All good. Coding along.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,All good,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,The material used and the explanations afterwards,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Sometimes the speed of coding demonstration was high and difficult to follow.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,work along was good.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,could do pivots for repeated measurements? That would maybe give more context?,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Good with both reading and explaining for understanding the concept.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"No ideas for improvement, yet another really good session.",NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Exercising the data,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"If some more time can be assigned for this section, it may provide more time for the participants to complete their tasks and understand not only copying the instructor's code.",NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Very useful code,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,No suggestions,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,I enjoyed the step-by-step approach to understand how you can re-arrange non-comprehensible data.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"Maybe there should be more ""links"" to the end product. Like ""we do this to, for instance, end up with a table 1, where we want to show..."". It is much easier grasping what to re-arrange when you have an (visual) idea of the end product.",NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Great with slowly progressing on building a pivot table and in the end as a function,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,More examples and practice,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,summaries data using pivot,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,nothing,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,The illustrations in the reading material are good for understanding.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"Be a bit more specific in the introduction on, where it is especially useful.",NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,guidance - teaching and practice,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,No comments,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"It was a great session, I have used gather and spread in the past and it is true that they are more confusing. Special mention to the figures, they help a lot to understand what's the process of pivoting",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"It actually doesn't count as pivot, but for a while I had problems transposing my data with t(). I think that a brief mention on this could be helpful to many people.",NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,The tasks and I liked a lot that the short cuts were repeated often - that helped a lot to remember them.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,in general: briefly explaining the output would help to understand also better what the code does,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,graphics in reading material illustrated concepts well,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,The removal on NAÂ´s - can you incidentially remove non complete data? A bit more on what to do with incomplete data,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,learning about pivot,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,more examples,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,It was good,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Maybe using more functions on the dataset.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"Really well explained go-through of code and applicability. A lot of ""AHA"" experienced, as this session nicely summed up what we've been working towards throughout the last couple of days.",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"Not really too much to add. Would love a little more explanation of how this could be applied to the mmash dataset, but i guess that applies for the ""free time"" this afternoon :-)",NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Pivots are powerful in data analysis and this was a great introduction.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"The overall session was good but if one really needs to comment, instructors could pay more attention to keep showing the code after running (an overall comment for the course in general).",NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,It was good to see some of the  problems that one ca encounter  during re-arranging data.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"Since this topic need a bit more time to grasp, I think it would be beneficial to  have the groups discuss the code building among themselves. Like discussing , parts of the code for pivoting such as this is the function, this si argument etc.",NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"Figures in syllabus, step from ""simple"" codes to functoins",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Explain why functions are also helpfull if you use them once,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"it worked well, but I have used pivot_longer and pivot_wider before",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,it was all good,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Overall the course structure and graphical illustration of the workflow we worked through were helpful.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,I felt the pivot functions would require more explanations. Why we specifically need to use them wasn't clear to me.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"The way it was explained how pivots works, made it easier to grasp the concept",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"I think you stated something along the lines that ""doing long pivot would be advantageous"". That a long df was better than a wide. I still don't see why.",NA
