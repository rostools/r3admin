Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Brain stoming
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Don't know. Maybe as above
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Exercise 9.3 made very little sense to me, as we hadn't really learned this yet and no one in the class figured it out. It became very hard very quick in the afternoon. I think there's too little repetition throughout the course. Learning requires repetition and I don't feel like there's much opportunity for this."
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"I am not sure, I think it was a super good session"
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,I think you're already doing great!
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,It is difficult to see if everything has been joined in the right way. There does not seem to be a control function and you are unable to visually inspect the new joined dataset if you work with large datasets
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,It's not the course's fault but I found the regex part confusing. It is a difficult topic to understand  and I think it could be given more time for a better explanation.
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Less time for reading
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,More short breaks instead of one long for eating lunch. The last our was looong.

Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,The excercise instructions could be a bit clearer
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"The tempo went suddenly a bit up, which made it difficult to follow in why we were doing the small changes in steps. But I think overall it was very well structured."
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Why duplication is the example is an issue, (day vs. sample column) was initially a bit unclear."
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,a little break needed
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"after 9.5 the session speed was too fast (or the day was too long, or the night was too short)"
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,more contents
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,no comments
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,not sure
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,nothing
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,the rules of the regex was really hard to grasp
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,too fast at the end and needed to slow down with maybe few explanations through the coding along
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",A little more exercise and less group talk
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Asking us to read a section, and then repeating what was important from the section seemed a bit.... repetitive"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Could perhaps speed things along although I appreciate that everyone needs to be able to follow the lessons
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","I am not sure, I think it was a super good session"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","I have no complaints, and no ideas for improvements"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",It was difficult to remember the final part of the day before. Maybe a short review should help to move forward.
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Less time for reading
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Maybe a little more ""how to use this on your own data sets"""
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Maybe, force us more to put up questions."
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Need to write more clear that you have to save your markdown file/scripts before restarting and checking the functionsStart earlier - 8 o'clock?
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","No comments really, it was good"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",No suggestions
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Nothing in particular I can think of.
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",The roxygen skeleton needs further introduction and emphasis because it can seem redundant to write the code into this format when we are already documenting each step of the process by saving the code chunks
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Time increase
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",more contents

Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",nothing
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",perhaps a summary at the end of the session will be good as it was spread over two days
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","sometimes, the session could have speed up a little"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",was very nice

Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Nice pace of the class, not too slow and not too fast :)"
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Particularly enjoyed lerning about reduce and cause_when. I have bene using ifelse until now and when using many conditions, it gets confuisng and error prone. Really useful stuff."
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Same as above
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Same as before, applies to all sessions, but really good combination of reading, having it explained, coding together and then on your own, slowly but effectively builds understanding and confidence in what you do. Also nice with many repetitions of the things from yesterday, e.g. making functions - difficult (for beginners at least) tasks that are really nice to repeat in different variations."

Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Great exercises
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",It was a reall productive session. I have been using apply before but it has been cool to see the dplyr alternative and dig in on how it works
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","It was useful to learn how to use the functionals to manipulate data frames (summarising statistics, renaming etc.)"
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Nice pace of the class, not too slow and not too fast :)"

Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",They instructions were good
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Very applied and relevant. It can save you so much time in the future. I hope I can copy-paste it onto my own data
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",all good. good explanation through the course
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",all worked well
