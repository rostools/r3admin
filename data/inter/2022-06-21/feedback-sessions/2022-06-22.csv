Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","I have no complaints, and no ideas for improvements",NA
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Same as before, applies to all sessions, but really good combination of reading, having it explained, coding together and then on your own, slowly but effectively builds understanding and confidence in what you do. Also nice with many repetitions of the things from yesterday, e.g. making functions - difficult (for beginners at least) tasks that are really nice to repeat in different variations.",NA

Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",It was a reall productive session. I have been using apply before but it has been cool to see the dplyr alternative and dig in on how it works,NA
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","No comments really, it was good",NA
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Particularly enjoyed lerning about reduce and cause_when. I have bene using ifelse until now and when using many conditions, it gets confuisng and error prone. Really useful stuff.",NA
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,It's not the course's fault but I found the regex part confusing. It is a difficult topic to understand  and I think it could be given more time for a better explanation.,NA

Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,It's quite easy to follow the step by step instructions by the instructor.,NA
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Exercise 9.3 made very little sense to me, as we hadn't really learned this yet and no one in the class figured it out. It became very hard very quick in the afternoon. I think there's too little repetition throughout the course. Learning requires repetition and I don't feel like there's much opportunity for this.",NA
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",revision of previous functions,NA
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Time increase,NA

Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Very applied and relevant. It can save you so much time in the future. I hope I can copy-paste it onto my own data,NA
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",The roxygen skeleton needs further introduction and emphasis because it can seem redundant to write the code into this format when we are already documenting each step of the process by saving the code chunks,NA

Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,It is difficult to see if everything has been joined in the right way. There does not seem to be a control function and you are unable to visually inspect the new joined dataset if you work with large datasets,NA
