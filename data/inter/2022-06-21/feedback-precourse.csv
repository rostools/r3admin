"In your opinion, what worked well?",Clear and concise writing
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything went rather smoothly. Good and clear instructions.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Everything worked for me at the first attempt, no complains."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything!
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Good description of what each individual step of code means.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Good description. Everything worked.. Good work!
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Great to be prepared for the course
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I had trouble with getting started (see command here below) - the pop-up window did not come up, and I was super frustrated and ended up using over an hour on google to figure out how to fix it. This did not help. If I had not gotten help from Isabell, I would not have managed to figure out what was wrong. So a better description of what to do, if this does not work would help (you link to a webpage if this happens, but this was not helpful., for me at least). The rest of the introduction hereafter was super, super good and easy to follow! :)""# A pop-up to type in your name (first and last), # as well as your emailr3::setup_git_config()"""
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I really like that we get to prepare in advance, it saves time on the course and makes sure everyone is in line once the couse begins."

"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Everything worked fine
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I might be a bit confusing for those who have handled more raw data before
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think it was a pretty good pre-task :-)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think it was sometimes unclear what sections of the introduction course you wanted us to go back and read (and how much of them).
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",In my opinion there could be some more short demo videos or description to the context that opens to a new window.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",It is a bit unclear whether we also should make a repo ready on Git before the course

"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Too long to read!
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Well, it is difficult to say. I generally find the wording and way of doing things in R incomprehensible and overly inconvenient. For example running all these steps just to download the dataset. I guess it is because we should learn how to do these steps manually by writing the code instead of using the dropdown menu."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Where possible and relevant, if you have good you tube video links, adding those would be  helpful ."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",no clever suggestions
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","nothing, besides a little more assistance in case the first part creates trouble (see my answer above)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",video clarifying more will be better as in the beginners guide
Please describe the problems you've had.,Codes are not working in the console
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I already described it. But getting error message  at this command:unzip(here(""data-raw/mmash-data.zip""),       exdir = here(""data-raw""),      junkpaths = TRUE)Error message: I unzip(here(""data-raw/mmash-data.zip""), exdir = here(""data-raw""),  :  error 1 in extracting from zip file"
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I attempted to use git (taking into account the lessens of the beginners course). During the committing step, Git wanted to save all my desktop files (also personal ones) and did not confine to the R project. Not sure why, as I followed the guide very closely. Manually deselecting each private file crashed R during multiple tries."
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I encountered several problems. Initially I experienced problems with incompatible versions/updates of R, Rstudio and Rtools. I fixed that problem by using an older version of Rtools. Another problem I faced was related to a package I did not have installed. In that case Google helped me :)"
Please describe the problems you've had.,In the beginning some of the codes did not work - it was related to updating to the newest version of Rtools. Problem solved.
Please describe the problems you've had.,The last section on downloading the data was giving some errors. I am trying to figure it out before the course
Please describe the problems you've had.,see me previous answer
Please describe the problems you've had.,"unfortunately I could not solve the problem with ""r3::check_setup()"". I always get this error as stated in the survey."
