Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","""Basic setup and workflow"" was a bit too slow"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Can go a bit faster
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Could possibly been speeded up a bit.
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",I do not think of anything for now
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",I think it was clear
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",It was well organised
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",More code-along and less time explaining the motivations of the course ( we are all convinced reproducibility is awesome!). Interesting to see how this applies to real data sets with thousands of rows and columns
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","No idea, I am happy!"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","The pace was a bit too slow for me, but I understand some people need more time. Maybe a bit too much repetition?"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","The spec() part, and why we copy the output in the following import code was a bit confusing. Better basic explanation on why we do that?"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",To tell people what the final goal is so that they know why they would not want to have warnings or so.
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","a bit higher tempo or additional exercises for advanced users, some tedious waiting"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",nothing
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",perhaps more examples on how to do stuff?
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",A bit to stressful.
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",It worked fine
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","More code along, more complex functions"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",Tomorrow
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",Tomorrow!
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","a bit higher tempo or additional exercises for advanced users, some tedious waiting"
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Clear, easy to follow instructions."
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Good overview of the background, good rythm of ""Importing data, fast"" session"
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Interesting to learn about vroom
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",It was easy to understand and we had a nice refresh of quarto and git without having to go through explaining them from the beginning.
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",It was good understandable
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","It was straight-forward, very clear and explanatory."
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Nice documentation and explanation.
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","The functions themselves are good, and walking people through the step by step elimination of warning messages is nice"
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",The pace was good and it was easy to understand what is happening and why the imported libraries were chosen. Especially go through the help of vroom was helpful
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Very clear!
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","i like that it aligns well with tidyverse so we can use ""familiar"" terms"
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",including all
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",no problems
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",not to big group this time
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",Really nice to see how easy is to make an actual function
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",Taking it step by step
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","This was a bit rushed, I guess due to time, but I will have liked to have it at a slower pace since I have never done it before. But in general, clear"
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",Tomorrow
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",Tomorrow!
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",no problems
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",worked well overall
