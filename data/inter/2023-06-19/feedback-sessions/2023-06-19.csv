Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","""Basic setup and workflow"" was a bit too slow",NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","The functions themselves are good, and walking people through the step by step elimination of warning messages is nice",NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",To tell people what the final goal is so that they know why they would not want to have warnings or so.,NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",including all,NA

Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",It worked fine,NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Interesting to learn about vroom,NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",More code-along and less time explaining the motivations of the course ( we are all convinced reproducibility is awesome!). Interesting to see how this applies to real data sets with thousands of rows and columns,NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",Really nice to see how easy is to make an actual function,NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","More code along, more complex functions",NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",The pace was good and it was easy to understand what is happening and why the imported libraries were chosen. Especially go through the help of vroom was helpful,NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",I do not think of anything for now,NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Clear, easy to follow instructions.",NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Could possibly been speeded up a bit.,NA

Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",I think it was clear,NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","This was a bit rushed, I guess due to time, but I will have liked to have it at a slower pace since I have never done it before. But in general, clear",NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","i like that it aligns well with tidyverse so we can use ""familiar"" terms",NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",perhaps more examples on how to do stuff?,NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Nice documentation and explanation.,NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","The spec() part, and why we copy the output in the following import code was a bit confusing. Better basic explanation on why we do that?",NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",It was easy to understand and we had a nice refresh of quarto and git without having to go through explaining them from the beginning.,NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","The pace was a bit too slow for me, but I understand some people need more time. Maybe a bit too much repetition?",NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",not to big group this time,NA
