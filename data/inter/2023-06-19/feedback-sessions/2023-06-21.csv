Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Everything worked fine
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,I believe the whole joining dataframes reading part would have been easier for some people if it included an example where the duplication happens (because of matching 1 column but not the other)
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,I liked the session. I have learned a bit more about how to use dyplr to clean and prepare my data sets
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Maybe a bit too specific to one dataset? An overview of what could be done otherwise could have been nice (e.g., handling of missing values)"
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Mayde to fast for everyone to follow
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,No idea
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,a bit higher tempo (as usual) maybe
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,all good
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,nothing in particular
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,perhaps including reading about regexp in the precourse task? i found it very difficult to get my head around it as i heard it for the first time
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Na
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",more examples besides importing data
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,All good
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,All is clear
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Clear instructions
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Everything
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Good session, thanks!"
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Good tools for the future. Plenty of time for the exerices
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"It was a really good session, it was insightful"
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,It was clean and understandable
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,It was really intresting to learn about reduce and full jpin. Both tools i believe are super helpful.  I liked that we take the time to understand why we needed to use case when()
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,explanations for join and reduce were very useful. The website is very convenient.
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"reduce function would be my new fav, i guess"
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,worked well
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Na
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","map to replace for loop, definitely sth i need to try later"
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"I believe in hindsight that there was a lot of time given to read the first chunks on Day 1, and now time for reading was shorter, so maybe switch this around. Also, including examples on what the joining does, or why we want to pivot, other than the ones from the cheatsheet so that people understand in the reading sections would help."
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"I think explaining clearly the objective on why we are doing things. I know it will come later, but to start coding without knowing the final goal, can be tricky for beginners. I will also recommend the use of the white board to visualize things."
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"I think it was a really good session, it open my options to be better on my future data treatment"
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Maybe knowing from the start how the final table would look like and a thinking time on how to do it (description in English)
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,More exercise :)
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Really make sure everyone are' on the path'
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,animations of pivot transformation
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,everything worked fine
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,hmm cannot really think about it.
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,nothing
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,All good
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"Clear, easy to follow instructions. Good with repeating/using things we learned earlier in the course like doing functions."
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Good material
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,I like the part you used case example to achieve what we want to do
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,I think it was a really good session
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"It was taken step by step, very good"
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Smooth and nice pace
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"The data was a good example, because the data had all the issues one normally finds in real data (missing values, wrongly input data, etc)"
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,The exercises with stepwise modifications were really explanatory.
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,all worked well. Good to see all practical use for it
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,no problem
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"yes, sure!"
