"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,A bit faster ?
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"A bit slow, maybe a bit longer exercises where you work on your own / in groups."
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,Clearify what the functions do.
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,Do not know
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"Given that this is an intermediate course, it would be nice to move a little faster sometimes. Of course, everyone should be able to follow along, but most of the people who are lagging in the course are those who may not have had prior experience with R, making the day a little slow."
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,I don't have any suggestions for improvement at this stage.
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"It could be nice with a paper with all the ""genvejsknapper"" for Windows/Mac"
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"It felt a little long if you didn't have a lot of trouble. Long periods of waiting around. Maybe add a little task at the end of the import, so you get to use the table you just imported. Mostly so you would get the feeling that something happened. It was great with repetitions, but maybe the repetitions of importing the data could have been spread out a little bit more, it got a little dull :)"
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"Keeping in mind the experience levels of different students, I think it is designed suitably but  maybe the course design can be done in a more intensive way."
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"Maybe a slight change to the pre-course tasks. Can't really tell what, but maybe something that makes it more clear if you'd done something slightly wrong on the pre-tasks"
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"Maybe speed up the session a little bit and shorter breaks in the sessions. However, I understand that it can be necessary in the beginning to make sure that all are following along."
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,Maybe to explain a bit more the meaning of each steps and coding. To repeat it in order to record it better
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,Not 100% sure how exactly the back and forward thing does work.
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,Not much.
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,Not really any suggestions.
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,Nothing
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,Overall worked fine.
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"Perhaps pointing out what the end goal was - my codes worked, but I was a bit confused as to why I was doing them :)"
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"Quite a slow start with lots of issues. Don't know if you can incorporate more of the ""setting up"" in the precourse tasks."
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,Reduce some waiting time; maybe extra assignments or fun facts?
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"Shorter breaks would be fine, maybe speed up a tiny bit"
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,Smaller groups for the social activity.
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"Some of the people are in more advanced state, so a lot of times it felt a bit too slow in progress"
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"Some periods, there was a lot of waiting time - but ok for the first session getting everybody setup"
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"Sometimes I did not understand why we were writing the specific code, so it is better to clearly explain it in the beginning with detail explanation and very short explanation"
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,The beginning was too slow
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"The two sessions where we talked with our group were not as useful as I had hoped. My group had absolutely no experience with R (cleaning, collecting or analysing) data, so the discussions/networking sessions were quite useless and not worth the time or effort."
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,Took some time to set everyone up. Hard to do much about.
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,Very slow start
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,"hm, not sure. I think it was pretty nice!"
"Day 1, morning",could be improved for,maybe the hats? dont know how visible they were for the instructors. Having the option to check into the hotel the day before so that everyone can be there from the start and are not affected by the poor public transport on the day
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,Code a long sessions and explanations along for the different commands/functions. The exercises worked very well.
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,"Code along worked well. Nice to get some inspiration for importing data, and how to import using the correct data types. Also, how you can import only some rows, to get a glimpse of your data, before importing everything."
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,Detailed instructions
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,Everything
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,Everything - really liked the hats on the laptops and the pace was perfect with good explanations at every step
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,"Everything. In particular, the instructors were very helpful. This is the first course I have had where the help was so good."
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,"Fair tempo. Nice with both some ""code-along"" and some individual coding."
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,"Good assistance from the teachers, code_along worked fine. Orange hat system workede"
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,"Good system with the hats. Clear instructions, quick help when needed."
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,Hats worked perfect :-) good pace - room to actually understand the code
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,"I appreciate the code-along sessions followed by trying to develop the code myself. I don't know how easy the hats are for the instructors to see, but I like having a way to show if I was successful with a step or not."
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,I think the exercises were very easy to follow for the beginner and it was well explained each part what is used for.
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,I think the hats worked. Much better than lifting your hand if having trouble as it was in previous statisitics courses.I appreciate the speed. I hav to wake up super early to be here and it is great that I can easily follow despie being quite tired.also appreciate the social breaks in between
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,Learned the ways of importing and managing data
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,Nice tempo/pace. Great exercises.
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,Nice workflow with switch between individual exercise and plenum lectures
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,Pace was good
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,"Plenty of time for questions and the code-along and the online material is really nice, also for use later when you actually have your data and maybe have forgotten some of the tricks. And good with the exercises after."
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,"Switching between code-along, reading and exercises."
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,The code along sessions are great. I really like that format.
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,The code along was nice.The hats worked
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,The code alongs. and when you take time explaining why we are doing things and what the codes do.
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,"The hats! Worked a lot better than the sticky notes! Also very good to go through the setup once more in the morning, to make sure that everything was still running. My setup worked when I did the pre-course tasks, but for some reason not this morning. It was great to have the time to check and fix that."
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,The helper explanations
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,"The introduction to the course, the venue, the structure and the teachers. The different ways of learning/conducting the course - reading, typing, discussing. Very well structured."
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,The last part with importing data
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,The origami hats! Awesome. All of the day.
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,The step-by-step code-alongs worked really nicely.
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,The support from the instructors solving individual issues
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,The tempo of the day was really nice - nice and slow to get everyone started
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,Type along.  hats worked fine
"Day 1, morning",worked well for,"Very varying session types, which was great. Especially starting the day with estabilishing levels. Hats work great. Giving us time to think before discussion is great - and very rearly utilized by teachers. Time for socialising outdoors is great after lunch."
