"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"The tempo was super great. I understand functions much better now, and there were no long pauses of sitting around.",Intermediate
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"For me, I still don't know what to use functions for in my work. But there was provided a lot of examples, so I don't really know how it could be improved. Maybe some more ""everyday"" scenarios, or just alternative things to use functions for.",Intermediate
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Good explanations of functions,Intermediate
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,just enough time for the exercise,Intermediate

"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Nothing to say,Intermediate
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"No need to insist on metaphors or explanations in a 1 to 1 while others are listening to all comments, can be kind of humiliating. Find another way to explain things or just give answers and explaining them. Faster and easier for all.",Intermediate

"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"The pace was good, had issues at some point and had time to follow up. The topic was a bit more difficult so maybe more time could be used here",Intermediate
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,The screen was really hard to follow along with in this session - the code was run to fast before you could write it and then not shown on the screen,Intermediate
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"code along session is nice. I don't know about the reading task for functions when it is still so new to everyone. The instructor almost had to read it all over together with us, so it felt a bit ""x2"" at some points. And it is hard to understand reading it on your own.",Intermediate
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"Maybe like, if we glimpsed all the files together to sort of set a perspective to the functions. Otherwise, it sometimes feels like we code blind or missing the end point perspective. However, i know it is hard to understand when it is all new.",Intermediate
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"Good explanations, good with exercises",Intermediate
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"It was hard for instructors to see when some of us put out orange hat up, which can be frustrating because you cant move on with the rest. Also sometimes when she did something on the screen, like moving the code from learning.qmd to .R files, it was a bit too fast, so it was hard to follow what she did and do it yourself at the same time",Intermediate
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"If we encounter any problem, help from instructors were quick",Intermediate
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"pace was slow, and I feel more likely copy and paste the code instead of learning it, so it can be better explaned why we are doing each step nicely",Intermediate
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Explaining vectors and how it can be perceived. How R can work with vectors using purrr as an alternative to for loops.,Intermediate
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"Guess not much. Would be nice to see how one can make a more vector-based approach to ""looping"" over multiple arguments. For instance, you often may want to obtain an estimate for each age group, for each sex, for each calendar year.",Intermediate
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Everything worked,Intermediate
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"A bit slow, maybe there could be optional assignments that require a bit more thinking, rather than copy-pasting and slightly modifying previous code.",Intermediate
