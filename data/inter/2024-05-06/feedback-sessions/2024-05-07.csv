"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,A bit more of time to do the training exercises
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,All good.
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,Day 1 could have been a bit faster.
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,Do not know.
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"For me, I still don't know what to use functions for in my work. But there was provided a lot of examples, so I don't really know how it could be improved. Maybe some more ""everyday"" scenarios, or just alternative things to use functions for."
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,I think it was pretty well constructed
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,I think some of the reading sessions are a bit hard to understand (if you are a complete beginner at least). Maybe a bit more explanation.
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"I would like a little bit more information on the functions and the argument part. Maybe try to read a function in words ""i am telling R, to find X and read Y"" etc."
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,It was great and might be bit overwhelming for beginners (not me)
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"Maybe a list of the base functions (fx ""return"")"
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,More detail about how to identify which package a function is from.
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"Move faster forward, less typing together"
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,No comments
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,No improvements I can think of
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"No need to insist on metaphors or explanations in a 1 to 1 while others are listening to all comments, can be kind of humiliating. Find another way to explain things or just give answers and explaining them. Faster and easier for all."
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"Not much, worked well"
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,Nothing
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,Nothing :-)
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,Session was good. Is it possible to link to an overall guide for more complex functions? Or to provide some examples for this
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,Some are waiting alot and others dont have enough time..
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,The 30min task did not take 30min; more like 15min
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,dunno
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,i think it was great!
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,it was nice
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,just enough time for the exercise
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"maybe more detailed explanation can be given when you start teaching new thing, but everything is fine"
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,more examples on the other parts of the functions like examples and export
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,nothing
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,noting :-)
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"A bit more spedy session, it was nice to start coding after a bit slow start yesterday"
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"Clear, quick help"
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Code along
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Code along sessions.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"Code along, description of what to remember for guides"
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Code-along followed by practice on my own. I appreciate the chance to try it myself.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Evrything
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Exercises repeating the code-along
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Exercises where you could practice making functionals.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Good exercises
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Good explanations of functions
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Good with exercises and repetition
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Great introduction to functions. Good time for the exercises especially 6.6
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"It was nice with a bit larger exercise, where we also had to use what we did yesterday."
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,It was very well explained and documented
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"Learning functions, sourcing them and importing functions"
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Nice to repeat the different tasks to get to do it a few times. Again the slow pace was nice
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"Nice with a individual exercise with different datasets to get the functions ""into the hands"""
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Nothing to say
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Questions were answered nicely and clearly
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,The basic information on data dependency and the issues of loading packages from library was really nice. Also having a separate function sheet was a great tip.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,The formatting and storing/sourcing of the functions. The exercise.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"The structure - lessons, exercise and discussing."
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,The support of the trainers
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,The tempo was better than the first session. Good exercises. Great explanations. Very useful in my everyday work.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"The tempo was super great. I understand functions much better now, and there were no long pauses of sitting around."
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Time to solve the exercise by yourself was good
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"Very hands on use of functions. Nice to do it over and over to get used to it. It is well put together, that we keep using the steps we have just learned and then adding new steps."
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"easy to follow, good pace, especially important to do the exercise in the end which helps to see whether the info has really been understood"
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,everything was perfect. thank you!
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,nice that we got to repeat making functions
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"A bit slow, maybe there could be optional assignments that require a bit more thinking, rather than copy-pasting and slightly modifying previous code."
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,A bit too long reading tasks
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,A bit too slow
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Could use more details about anonymous function
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Do not know
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Exercise 7.3 was not as clear as the other exercises.
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"Guess not much. Would be nice to see how one can make a more vector-based approach to ""looping"" over multiple arguments. For instance, you often may want to obtain an estimate for each age group, for each sex, for each calendar year."
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"I struggle still to understand what an anonymous function actually is, but following the coding structure is clear enough.it can be hard to follow the coding sometimes from the back of the room: It really helped when the screen is zoomed in."
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"It was hard for instructors to see when some of us put out orange hat up, which can be frustrating because you cant move on with the rest. Also sometimes when she did something on the screen, like moving the code from learning.qmd to .R files, it was a bit too fast, so it was hard to follow what she did and do it yourself at the same time"
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,It's too overwhelming at certain time
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Larger hats ;)
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"Maybe like, if we glimpsed all the files together to sort of set a perspective to the functions. Otherwise, it sometimes feels like we code blind or missing the end point perspective. However, i know it is hard to understand when it is all new."
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"Maybe slightly slow tempo, but it is difficult due to different levels at the course"
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Nothing
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Nothing that comes to mind
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Show the code --> scroll up
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"Sometimes moved from code a bit fastI would have loved to have had a quarto documuent for making notes of all the steps, instead of having to delete stuff."
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Still a little unclear what the end game is here
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,The exercise on functionals was difficult to understand. Maybe a short explanation on the objective of the exercise by the trainer would help
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,The pace was a bit slow and more examples with more statistical functions could have been used
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,The screen was really hard to follow along with in this session - the code was run to fast before you could write it and then not shown on the screen
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,dont know
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,i feel like i still need to practice a lot for using the functions and functionals for my own data analysis.
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,it was pretty slow and a lot of waiting time on top of the long breaks
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"nothing, it went well"
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,nothing.
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,ok
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"pace was slow, and I feel more likely copy and paste the code instead of learning it, so it can be better explaned why we are doing each step nicely"
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,progress faster
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"when we are asked to knit qmd, it would have been nice if it said render for consistency."
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"Again, good code along."
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Codealong
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"Easy to follow the ""together programming"""
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Everything
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Everything worked
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Examples for how the different functionals work
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"Exercises where we could practice the coding by ourself, but with a good introduction from the instructor."
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Explaining vectors and how it can be perceived. How R can work with vectors using purrr as an alternative to for loops.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Explanations and emphasising the meaning of each steps and coding written.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"Good explanations, good with exercises"
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Good tasks and good explanations of new functions and tools
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Great code along. Nice to learn about functions.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Great pace. Excellent exercises
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"Great session in general, very usable things to learn."
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"If we encounter any problem, help from instructors were quick"
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,In general it was a beginner friendly
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,NIce to slowly see the df combined from all the files
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,The code alongs are fun
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,The functionals were simply great
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"The pace was good, had issues at some point and had time to follow up. The topic was a bit more difficult so maybe more time could be used here"
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,The subject was nicely explained.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"The tempo was quite nice, the workflow was very nice."
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,This is very useful information and it is great to practice it myself after seeing the explanation.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Useful learnings for future research
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Useful part for future datahandling skills. Good hands on.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Very useful to learn
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"code along session is nice. I don't know about the reading task for functions when it is still so new to everyone. The instructor almost had to read it all over together with us, so it felt a bit ""x2"" at some points. And it is hard to understand reading it on your own."
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,easy to follow int he lecture (especially because I already have dplyer experience)very nice to have the website along the lecture!
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,everything
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,i love functions <3 so fun
