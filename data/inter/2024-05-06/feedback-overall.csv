2024-05-08,"Very good course, highly recommend. The setup wasn't super clear, but other than that very good. Especially considering that there were plenty of different levels at the course."
2024-05-08,"I expected it to be a bit more advanced, but I guess it is at an appropriate intermediate level. Looking forward to the advanced course! Maybe introduce for loops here already?"
2024-05-08,"A little more about the idea behind of using the functions we are using, especially the anonymous function is still a bit unclear when to use for me"
2024-05-08,Attended the introduction course with no prior experience with R and reproducibility as a concept. I learned a lot and it continued with this course. Well build course material and nice sessions. Especially enjoy the code along sessions!
2024-05-08,"Very minor feedback, but it was a little annoying that people from far away (for instance Odense and Copenhagen) couldn't get a hotel room from the night before. The first day kind of suffered a bit from most people being very tired from being up that early."
2024-05-08,love your courses.
2024-05-08,Excellent online materials!
2024-05-08,I would like more clinical/real world examples. When to use this in what situation. The color/letter illustrations were tricky to understand
2024-05-08,"Very good online material! The first day was quite slow - maybe some things could be added to the precourse tasks, or maybe one more instructor/helper on day 1. Learned some really nice things that can be used in everyday work. Hope there will be a course on working on very large datasets :)Thanks for a great course!"
2024-05-08,"maybe the explanations given in the lectures could be supported using examples with other data, before we then practice it together with the data provided"
2024-05-08,"the Website is super helpfull,"
2024-05-08,"Hats work really well! However, for people who don't struggle a lot the pace can be quite slow some times. There is quite some waiting time and a lot of breaks. I think the course days could definitely be shorter if there was a way to speed things up a bit. Even just taking shorter coffee and lunch breaks, as there is a lot of time. Generally the course was awesome and I learned a lot - the switches between reading, code alongs, exercises and listening to the instructors work really smoothly."
2024-05-08,I liked the course very much . Just right amount of input. I would be up for a whole week of that course with more input the nxt days. I hope to attend the advanced course as well
2024-05-08,Very nice course! It will be fun to try applying it to my own dataset.Nice location and hotel
2024-05-08,"I think functions are hard, when you haven't worked with it before. Just a fun idea, maybe you could do a similar function like this entire course on a smaller amount of data, and then at the end, apply it to a large data set ""to see the true power"" and ""the magic happens"". However it was a nice course overall! Well done :)"
2024-05-08,There could be more exercises to practice after each session and discuss it all together after it
2024-05-08,"There could be more exercises where we have to use the things we learn, maybe just an optional at home task with another dataset to try to use it yourself. Overall it was a bit slow, so also maybe some optional extra exercises or something to get even more out of the course."
2024-05-08,"I think we have too many/too long scheduled breaks. Considering that some of the sessions need to go slow so that everyone can follow along, the times where some people would wait for others were a perfect opportunity to grab a coffee/take a short break. In addition to this, we could have made the lunch break shorter as well, since there are so many small breaks during the sessions. This would have made the days shorter, which is always nice :)"
2024-05-08,"The location for the course wasn't really ideal. It's a nice location, but because this course requires code-along segments, the setup of the room really disadvantages those seated in the back. The instructors had then to zoom their screens a lot, which was then unpleasant for them and the people sitting in the front. The days get quite long sitting in one spot, but I think the instructors are very cognizant of this and make sure to take lots of breaks and/or end early as needed. I really appreciated that the instructors didn't rush through the material in order to stick to a strict timeline."
2024-05-08,Shout out for the enormous amount of work that has been put into this course. Both pre-course material (so cool) and also that the material is available afterwards is so crucial for being able to actually use it in everyday coding.
2024-05-08,Also nice if you all introduced yourself with background as a start - to know your background and why you do exactly this. Give your best hacks for R - e.g. changing R layout to improve visuability or similar.
2024-05-08,"At the moment, this is the best course I ever attended in terms of integrating theory and practicals, and all this was at a pace that fitted my capabilities perfectly. Support and help from instructors also was very good. So thank you very much!"
2024-05-08,"For me, it was hard to even understand some of the things we were to read on the website. It was a totally new language for me, and therefore sometimes hard to follow, and therefore I did not completely get the whole idea behind the things we did and why. But all in all I think it was a very good course, and I feel like it would probably help me to just try to do some data wrangling myself. Thanks!"
2024-05-08,"A bit less reading tasks. In general, I loved the course."
2024-05-08,It would be nice to be able to get a hotel room the day before - alternatively the sessions should start later so everyone can arrive - it is a long way from cph
2024-05-08,The overall layout was fine. The instructors made the environment very friendly and were ready to help. I am looking forward to the advance course.
