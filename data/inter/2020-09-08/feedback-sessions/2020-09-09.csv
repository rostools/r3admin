Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","A general comment is, that I think we could learn more from the course if there were more time to practice the tasks. A thought could be to do more half days so that we have the chance to look at the programme between the sessions."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","It was a bit harder to follow this part of the course compared to the first part. Further, I think it is a bit too long time to try focus and work within the programme - it affected the concentration in the end."
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",It is great that several instructors are ready to give feedback and help doing the course.
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",It is great that several instructors are ready to give feedback and help doing the course.
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"A general thought in line with previous comments is that an idea could be to spread the course over a longer period of time, so that we had the chance to work on the different sections between the course days. That would have meant that I ""mentally"", would have been more ready for this last section."
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Dont know.
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,If the course was prolonged with another day then maybe we would have more energy to follow along and complete all the steps.
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,It got a little too rushed which was a shame. The course could benefit from a third day
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"It think this session was very important but it was difficult for me to focus after the first session of the day. May be with additional exercises, this session can be performed on an extra day for the intermediate course."
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"It was only a shame that there was not enough time to over it all, I think the content was very nice, especially the debugging."
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"It's a bit hard to concentrate at the end of this part - maybe having a bit shorter days, and have an extra day (day 3) would help?"
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Maybe a bit too many details on the pivoting functions and too little practical exercise. In my experience pivoting can cause a loot of problems, that you usually do not think about until they occur."
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,More time
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"No comments, I would just say more time maybe for the remaining part we did not finish. I would also like to see creation of functions to use for linear regression models."
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Nothing
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Nothing that I can think of now
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"The same goes here, more reading or watching materials before the course"
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,This was a bit too complecated for me. But might have been suitable for others.
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,as above
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"don't do it at last afternoon, we had to go over it quite fast :("
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,nothing
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,the cut and past from the lesson (markdown) document was a bit tricky since we had so much other code in there
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",A lot of the code-along section did not specify arguments. I would prefer to get them defined the first time when using them.
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Could maybe make use of titles ## a bit more if possible.
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","I think there was too much time for exercises or maybe just a need for additional exercises, for the people who do not have too many problems"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","I think this session was intense. I feel that, after this session we all become tired and could not focus well to the next session."
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","In general (all sessions), some more clear breaks would help."
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",It could be great to do some of the tasks on datasets that we will use in real-life later on - but I know that it might not be possible within the short time.
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Maybe I felt like I needed information on how to use everything as documentation for others - like if we should link or refer to our statistics in a paper, how would we do that? Would it be with a R markdown file?"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",More exercises might be interesting
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",More explanations along the way
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",More reading materials and hands on before the course
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","No comments, really good!"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Nothing
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Perhaps there was a little too much time for the exercises, but that is also sometimes quite nice... and I know some people struggled"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","The exercises took a bit too long, I ended up waiting around quite a bit"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",There was quite a bit of content to be covered.
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",maybe small groups working to speed up things
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",nothing
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","sometimes going too fast and i was missing the point of doing some of the steps, as you try and hurry to keep up and get it right"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",the instructor needed to explain more what we were doing and when

Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",I can't think
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",I like how you learn to go back and clean up your markdown file.
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",I think that there were lots of nice exercises that meant we could go away and learn how to troubleshoot the problems we faced.
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",It was really nice to experience that we 'wrapped the work up' - it somehow gave an overview of what we had been doing.
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",The concepts were clearly explained with examples
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Think it all worked fine. Think its really good when the lecture adds titles to the codes - makes it easier for us to keep track on what we are doing.
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Very simple and concise way of teaching the concept, especially regular expressions. I never knew that you could export data as a ready R-data file, so it was great to know that that is possible."
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Very useful... the whole code-along and the material was super great
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","We got appropriate time to do the exercises, which where very meaningful."
