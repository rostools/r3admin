Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","A general comment is, that I think we could learn more from the course if there were more time to practice the tasks. A thought could be to do more half days so that we have the chance to look at the programme between the sessions.",NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",It is great that several instructors are ready to give feedback and help doing the course.,NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","It was a bit harder to follow this part of the course compared to the first part. Further, I think it is a bit too long time to try focus and work within the programme - it affected the concentration in the end.",NA
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",I think that there were lots of nice exercises that meant we could go away and learn how to troubleshoot the problems we faced.,NA
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",There was quite a bit of content to be covered.,NA

Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",the instructor needed to explain more what we were doing and when,NA
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,the content of the session,NA
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,the cut and past from the lesson (markdown) document was a bit tricky since we had so much other code in there,NA
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Think it all worked fine. Think its really good when the lecture adds titles to the codes - makes it easier for us to keep track on what we are doing.,NA
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Could maybe make use of titles ## a bit more if possible.,NA
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,All worked fine.,NA

Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",It could be great to do some of the tasks on datasets that we will use in real-life later on - but I know that it might not be possible within the short time.,NA
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Luke is good to explain the coding which give a higher understanding of the fundermental understanding of the elements behind coding.,NA
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"A general thought in line with previous comments is that an idea could be to spread the course over a longer period of time, so that we had the chance to work on the different sections between the course days. That would have meant that I ""mentally"", would have been more ready for this last section.",NA

Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,It was very interesting material,NA
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"It was only a shame that there was not enough time to over it all, I think the content was very nice, especially the debugging.",NA

Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","No comments, really good!",NA
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"I like how you create a clean version of the dataset that you start with after. Overall, the layout of how we should be organizing ourselves was the most helpful to mee.",NA
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"No comments, I would just say more time maybe for the remaining part we did not finish. I would also like to see creation of functions to use for linear regression models.",NA

Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","I think there was too much time for exercises or maybe just a need for additional exercises, for the people who do not have too many problems",NA
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Important subject about pivoting.,NA
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Maybe a bit too many details on the pivoting functions and too little practical exercise. In my experience pivoting can cause a loot of problems, that you usually do not think about until they occur.",NA

Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Maybe I felt like I needed information on how to use everything as documentation for others - like if we should link or refer to our statistics in a paper, how would we do that? Would it be with a R markdown file?",NA
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,We did not have much time but it was nice that Luke went through everything quickly,NA
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,If the course was prolonged with another day then maybe we would have more energy to follow along and complete all the steps.,NA
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Very simple and concise way of teaching the concept, especially regular expressions. I never knew that you could export data as a ready R-data file, so it was great to know that that is possible.",NA
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",A lot of the code-along section did not specify arguments. I would prefer to get them defined the first time when using them.,NA
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Worked very well overall.,NA
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Dont know.,NA
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Combining different data frames together, wrangling data into a final form and generating a framework to do that was very beneficial for me.",NA
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","I think this session was intense. I feel that, after this session we all become tired and could not focus well to the next session.",NA
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Coding along worked very well.,NA
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"It think this session was very important but it was difficult for me to focus after the first session of the day. May be with additional exercises, this session can be performed on an extra day for the intermediate course.",NA
