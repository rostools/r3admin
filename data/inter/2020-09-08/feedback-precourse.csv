What do you expect to learn from this course and what would you like to be able to do afterward with what you've learned?,"As I am very much self-taught when it comes to R and programming I often have the mentality that as long at the syntax do what I wish of it, it must be perfect. This is especially true for data-wrangling, where I somehow always end up with very messy raw-data.  I hope that this course might instil upon me a more ""official"" and simpler way to go about data-analysis (especially wrangling) using R. And also give me some pointers and critique  my ""not-optimal"" way of writing syntax."

"In your opinion, what worked well?",All the instructions detailed in step by step worked well.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Always very well-described. Thanks!
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything was written very clearly overall.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything worked well!
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Good to make sure the different elements are updated and ready for the course
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Having this pre-course material to begin with. It was great to have everyone set up what is needed for the course beforehand.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I had most of it up and running already. But it seemed like a good way to get people up to date with stuff.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Installation instructions are easy to follow.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It all ran smoothly
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was easy enough to set up the packages and project
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was great that you referred us back to the previous course in case we hav'nt completed this.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It worked well. Fair to refer to the material for the introduction course.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The coding examples make it very easy to follow
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The instructions in the pre-course tasks materials were clear and easy to follow.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The step-by-step instructions
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The steps to follow for Pre-course tasks are clear
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The thorough introductory material and access to material from the previous course.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Think its a really good idea with the ""check"" functions, to see if our current versions, installations etc. actually worked correctly. Works fine with linking back to the intro course description. Its a good way to go back and look at stuff we have already worked with to remind yourself on how the things worked."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Your instructions were very clear and understandable.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","specific, short tasks to be done."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","As of right now I see no areas for improvement. Very well though out! Also, not expecting too much in the pre-course assignment, due to people's existing workload. This was very feasible."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Cannot think of anything for now.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Encouragement to open the survey before beginning
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I could'nt complete the ""New project part"" as neither of the descriptions worked"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I was a bit unsure regarding the rtool package, whether it was installed correctly."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I was unsure whether my output from r3::check_project_setup() looks as it is supposed to.This was my first time installing Git and first there was no Git icon in RStudio, which confused me a lot. It appeared when I created my first project. A comment about this would have been helpful :-)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I would personally prefer installing the packages and running commands manually using something similar of a R-script file compared to a companion package (R3). This is as I prefer to know what exactly I am doing. Additionally, we ran some functions from the ""usethis"" package, without an explanation off the function. I would have appreciated a short description of the functions before having to run them."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It's super frustrating for non-computer-experts when program/package installation does not work and consequently takes hours. I had issues with updating the package xfun. I needed to delete it from both my programfiles and user R folder in order to finally install r3. Not sure if anything can be improved here, except maybe allow installation of parts of the r3 package and then be able to go back and sort out the rest later. As it is, the installation is terminated until ALL packages can be correctly installed/updated.Also, I couldn’t make this line of code work: prodigenr::setup_project(""~/Desktop/LearnR3"")It *does* create the project, but not all the subfolders, which causes problems in the next step. I ended up deleting the folder on the desktop and creating the project manually."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe more helping information such as 'If it does not work try to restart the programme' or 'delete the project and try again'. I spent a lot of time trying to solve errors and the solutions were very simple.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe some more concrete examples about how to use version control in our daily work
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe to soon to say now :)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Not easy to figure out what the problem is when getting errors in R. The webpage for the intro course is very similar to the one for this course, and I got them mixed up several times as the webpage links to the page for the first course."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Not your side but in general, IT services of all the universities should be improved :). It took one hour for me to complete this easy and clear instructions because I needed to enter my password in every step."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing that I can think of right now.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Pictures of kittens.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Text distribution could be improved. For example, I created a n RStudio project form the start to later realize that I was expected to create it by specific code typing so that the rest of the functions could work appropriately."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Think it all worked fine, one small think that I couldn't get to work when I went back and practiced a few things from the the intro course was: when I go back to read the ""Version control with Git"" I couldn't find the page you have on your screenshot for figure 8.8 in my Github account - especially I was curious on finding the ""...or push an existing repository from the command line"" code to put into the R-studio terminal. I assume that when we have created a new R project (LearnR3) this can later be linked with Github with use of that code from Github - I just couldn't seem to find it. But I guess we might do this together in the intermediate course."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",no issues.
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I already had RStudio open and must have needed to restart it, because it told me it encountered an error creating a new project. All sorted now!"
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I could'nt complete the ""New project part"" as neither of the descriptions worked"
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I got an promt using the prodigenr package to create a new project where it prompted me to answer ""no, no, yes"". The only problem was that it did not tell me what I answered yes to."
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I had one problem: Since I have not participated in your introduction course, I went through it myself. There, I could not figure out why chapter 9.6 “Remotes”: Storing your repository online did not work, specifically applying the ""Code to copy and paste to link and upload an existing Git repository in GitHub."""
Please describe the problems you've had.,I just did :)
Please describe the problems you've had.,Problems were solved! (1. Could not create a project as described [“Scientific Analysis Project using prodigenr” was not available]. 2. R returned an error when trying to make a markdown doc using r3::create_rmarkdown_doc() ).
