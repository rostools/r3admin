Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"General comment: At day 1, maybe explain what we want to end up with in the end? We have been working with a lot of different documents such as lessons.R and mmash.R, so e.g. we want to end up creating a script in mmsah.R that can load and prepare all of our data for us. We achive this by using the lessons.R document to create and test our functions. :-)",NA

Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,There was enough time to do the exercises / reading  and for questions,NA
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"The coding went a little bit too fast, so it was hard to ""code along"" and I was feeling a little bit ""behind"" all the time - so I would suggest to take down the speed and explain while coding instead of having it ready and then you have to do it yourself afterwards. the session felt a little bit stressingNot related to the session but in general: it would have been nice to have a short description of the dataset, to understand e.g. that day 1 and day 2 in the saliva dataset are coded as night and next morning. so background to the dataset, what is it that we are looking at? and why did we have to summarise the rr dataset? what was it we did here? But otherwise really good :)",NA

Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Mario is a bit to quick at typing compared to me, so I could not follow, besides you might want to change the description for the course""- know a little to a moderate amount of R (or computing in general);- know how to use R and have some familiarity with the tidyverse and RStudio.""Even though I have completed a statistic course where we did everything in R, I can feel that I am not at the same level as the remaining participants.",NA

Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,no to add more,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"tidying the data with ""simple"" code - the walkthrough worked well. In general, learning to generate functions that are more generic to apply to data was one of the highlights. And remembering the pipes - I will have to use these more :)",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Would always like more exercises - to improve on my own thinking.,NA
