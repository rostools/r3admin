Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,NA :-)
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,NULL
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,nothing
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,will answer tomorrow
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Brainstorm and discuss in groups could be a smaller part.
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Can't think of anything
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Generally some small bio breaks with up and stand or so to clear the head?
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",I have nothing to add.
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",It was a bit confusing to head into loops when the exercise wasn't about it. I also didn't feel super ready for the exercise after the lecture
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",It was a little hard to follow - perhaps don't need to show all the ways that it doesn't work as it makes it confusing.
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",It was fine
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Maybe a few extra words on the possibilities of the function in the dplyr/tidyverse packages. to get some more inspiration how they can be applied to your own data.
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Na
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Nothing
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Stille a bit difficult ;)
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","There were some overlap with the previous beginners course, and I am not quite sure how the two (using across vs. the filter, etc.) were that different. What do one gain from doing it this way and not the other?"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","do not think of anything more, that would make the course pretty intensive"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",more small breaks (just 5 min to stretch your legs and clear your head) - especially in the afternoon
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",nothing
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",the description of the exercisee 8.4
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,All of it
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,N/A (the first exercise for regex where quite good)
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,NA :-)
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,NULL
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,will answer tomorrow
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",All of it
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Everything was taken in a logical step-by-step manner
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Exercises and type alongs
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",In general the  sticky notes work really well
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",It was good to see how to make it easier to import the data all together
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",It worked well that he showed how apply loop etc. to show how map is better. Very good pace.
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Open my eyes up to the map and across function. Showing how code can be written more simple and still get the job done.
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","The combination of code-along, the online book, group discussion and exercises."
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","again, it was nicewith easy to follow exmples in the begining, so you get an understanding on what functionals can"
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",code-alongs and exercises.
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",exercises and repeating are really good :) helps learning it!
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",functions are cool
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",he explained how and why we used functions and loops
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","making functions was really good, I liked the idea of a chronological order, even though my mind keep jumping forward"
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","repetition from the day before, saving in git, add to description file etc. Learning how to make functiong"
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",the exercises
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",thoroughly and clearly explained.
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",very important and useful concept for using R
