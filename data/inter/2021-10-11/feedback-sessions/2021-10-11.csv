Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",I don't have any input for this.
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",I don't know if I would change anything
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","I have rarely come across data sets where each individual person is kept within one folder, often the dataset to be imported is one large file. Although, I can see how the import of data could be applied to such a dataset."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",In my opinion it is OK at this level.
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","It is difficult to catch up after something has failed, you need to receive help and then rejoin the group activities"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Maybe explain more what the different packages/functions does, e.g. here package in class. Maybe shorter time for reading and time in group discussion to gain more time for explaining whats happening."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Nothing comes to mind.
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",dont know
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","i might be too slow, but every time you had to cut or copy i did not have enough time which delayed me in the following tasks"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",it was good
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","maybe some introduction to the test data, what do we want to achieve in the end"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",maybe specify a bit cleare what we should discuss e.g. regarding workflow...or maybe it was just because I haven't learned enough about R I didn't understood it. But t helped when we discussed it afterwards :)
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",nothing
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",sometimes a little bit hard to follow
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",using datasets with lots of variables
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",I don't have any input for this either :-)
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","In direct contradiction to what i said for what could be improved for the morning sessions, i found that the afternoon sessions were a bit slow and I could have progressed quicker, with a bit less repetition. That only really serves to demonstrate that people will pick different things up at different rates. It seemed as thought the pace was quite appropriate for most."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","Maybe it would be better NOT to go through the ""advanced"" stuff after 3 in the afternoon."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","More exercises, in more advanced functions and how to combine multiple functions."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",Nothing

Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",may be making a more function
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",maybe even more practice
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",maybe mentioning other functions that can help you save time - e.g. apply function
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",more examples for possible functions?
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",more examples on how to apply it in own research
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",nothing
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","the code-along part could be difficult to follow sometimes, as she run the code before we could type it in"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",the same
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Basically everything, following along with the code and then trying it out yourself afterwards. The increasing in difficulty is appropriate. Good pace. Not to slow or too fast."
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Everything
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Following the code-along was easy.
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",It was clear and easy to follow
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","It was really clear and nice, vroom was new for me, it worked very well. I also learnt a different way of importing data, I would call it ""precise uploading"""
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",It worked well. Easy to get help. Scripts are working.
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Particularly fond of the exercises and code-alongs. Repetition was nice for my learning curve too.
