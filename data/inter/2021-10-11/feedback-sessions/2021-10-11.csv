Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","Maybe it would be better NOT to go through the ""advanced"" stuff after 3 in the afternoon.",NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Basically everything, following along with the code and then trying it out yourself afterwards. The increasing in difficulty is appropriate. Good pace. Not to slow or too fast.",NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",I don't have any input for this.,NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","The same as for ""Basic setup and workflow"" and ""Importing data, fast""",NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",I don't have any input for this either :-),NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","The figure with the overview, the table discusions, the different examples fx. how to load the different file types you come across",NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","Nice with the very basic functions at the beginning, so you are not lost",NA

Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","In direct contradiction to what i said for what could be improved for the morning sessions, i found that the afternoon sessions were a bit slow and I could have progressed quicker, with a bit less repetition. That only really serves to demonstrate that people will pick different things up at different rates. It seemed as thought the pace was quite appropriate for most.",NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",mix between exercises and lectures,NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",the examples and the explanations,NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","the code-along part could be difficult to follow sometimes, as she run the code before we could type it in",NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",basically everything,NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","i might be too slow, but every time you had to cut or copy i did not have enough time which delayed me in the following tasks",NA

Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","It was really clear and nice, vroom was new for me, it worked very well. I also learnt a different way of importing data, I would call it ""precise uploading""",NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",In my opinion it is OK at this level.,NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",making a function for data import was really good.  package decencies was also really good way to control they way packages work,NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",may be making a more function,NA
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Following the code-along was easy.,NA
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","I have rarely come across data sets where each individual person is kept within one folder, often the dataset to be imported is one large file. Although, I can see how the import of data could be applied to such a dataset.",NA
