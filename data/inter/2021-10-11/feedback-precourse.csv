What do you expect to learn from this course and what would you like to be able to do afterward with what you've learned?,"With this course, we aim to begin addressing this gap. Using a highly practical approach that revolves around code-along sessions (instructor and learner coding together), hands-on exercises, and group work, participants of the course will be able to:Learn and demonstrate what an open and reproducible data processing and analysis workflow looks like.Learn and apply some fundamental concepts, techniques, and skills needed for processing and managing data in a reproducible and well-documented way.Learn where to go to get help and to continue learning modern data science and analysis skills.The course will enable participants to answer questions such as:What does a modern data analysis setup and workflow look like?How can I create pipelines that get, process, and clean my data quickly and that works regardless of whether there is one data file or hundreds (i.e. it scales well)?How can I write code that is more reproducible, readable, and easily re-used for my future self and for my collaborators and colleagues?By the end of the course, participants will: have improved their competency in processing and wrangling datasets; have improved their proficiency in using the R statistical computing language; know how to write re-usable and well-documented code; and know how to make modern and reproducible data analysis projects."
What do you expect to learn from this course and what would you like to be able to do afterward with what you've learned?,be able to use R more sufficiantly - also with large dataset and how to organise then/make the data fit for analysing
"In your opinion, what worked well?","A good intruduction to the course, Git and R. Reading and doing task that at the same time include the steps for data processing sued in the course"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",All the information you need was giving
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I actually think all worked really well
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I have had some trouble, but I will go back and try to figure out the problem when I have time this weekend"
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I never used the R packages for data download, file management. It worked well for me."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",In the end where the whole code is listed all together is nice - good to have the overview
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was very clear
"In your opinion, what worked well?","It worked well, but I decided to briefly go through the whole beginner curriculum"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It works well that the codes are describe in layman terms and that the important links to the previous course is there.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It works well with the assignment rather than just read
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The descriptions are very thorough and easy to follow, I didnÂ´t run into any strange errors."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The guidelines
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The instructions are very thorough and easy to follow
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The instructions for installing the data set
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The instructions working through the pre-course tasks were mostly very clear
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The text was very easy to read. Very good description of the codes you run and why you do it.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Very good. I used more time than the 3-5hrs (more like two days, I was struggling with a code not working). This may be because I am still at the beginner level, but very useful to do the exercises at home.Very good with the links to the text from beginners course."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Very thoroughly explained.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",nice to do something before - to be more prepared
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","""Fejl: [ENOENT] Failed to move 'C:/Users/au606536/Desktop/LearnR3/data-raw/DataPaper'to 'C:/Users/au606536/Desktop/LearnR3/data-raw/mmash/DataPaper': no such file or directory""I got this error several times, however, i think i've done everythring right, but i am not sure"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",-
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",?
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Even though it is nice with all the information, it was also a bit confusing at times because I was to leave the page, enter a new one, go back to the first and then enter a new one again."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Everything was fine
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I do not have any comments for this
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I had a lot of trouble downloading the dataset. A timeout of 60 seconds was reached and I got a truncated version of the data. But I'm not sure it something that you can improve on.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I had some troubles getting the GIT button in the upper panel but a restart helped so the code was correct, I think."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I have no comments at this moment :)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It should be made clear in the email (not just after clicking on the link) how much time is required for the pre-course tasks. Furthermore, the potential difficulties of downloading Git and the potential need for IT support should be made clear in the email. This was a big surprise and it would have been too late for me to get IT tech support to download Git, as it was I found a work around. The process of downloading Git could in general have been clearer."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe an email or phone number to contact if some precourse tasks are challenging/struggling. One have to fill in the whole survey to write for help (even if you haven't finished the tasks). Otherwise all good :)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe more visual material (videos - link to youtybe etc.)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",No feedback here
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Perhaps you could let us know in the email that it will take quite some time, so we can set aside that time ;) (Or maybe you did and I didn't read it!)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","So far, I only spotted one spelling mistake :) (And now I cannot find it again)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The branched nature (and similar Markdown layout) of the recommended documents, makes it easy to be side tracked and spent time on unnecessary steps. I personally spent time looking into Git clients, which I now suspect is not strictly needed."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","for the pre course material, I do not think there is need to do more."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",make it possible to upload a screenshot of some error code. I am not sure all of the code delivered the right output
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",nothing

Please describe the problems you've had.,Downloading the data. But it worked out in the end :-) I'm also not sure the folders in my data-raw/ looks right?
Please describe the problems you've had.,Fejl: [ENOENT] Failed to move 'C:/Users/au606536/Desktop/LearnR3/data-raw/DataPaper'to 'C:/Users/au606536/Desktop/LearnR3/data-raw/mmash/DataPaper': no such file or directory
Please describe the problems you've had.,Problems with setting up the LearnR3 project in a folder on my H-drive. I could only direct the project to my desktop (which will be deleted in few weeks as I change my computer)
Please describe the problems you've had.,"Technical issues when downloaded R packages. They didn't run the first time, but the next time it worked. I might have skipped a step or something."
Please describe the problems you've had.,The last two steps did not work - but I will try to figure it out
