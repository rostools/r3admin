Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,It was really useful! And it was explained really thoroughly,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"It was a little slow at some points. Maybe it's because I have heard of the concept with pivots before (haven't tried using them though), but I found it relatively easy to understand and thus felt it was a little slow",NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,The code alongs,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,IT went a bit fast and sometimes it was hard to keep up,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"Great explanations for how pivots can be grasps. I think the step-by-step expanding of the functions is just a great way to comprehend what is actually going on. The code-alongs are great so that coding skills becomes more of a active ""vocabulary"" and not just passive ""vocabulary"" in terms of using it for our own projects.",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Nothing I could think of. Thanks for a great course!,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,All of it,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,I can't think of anything,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Getting to know the reasoning behind pivoting and learning how to apply to a dataset was a great experience,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Everything was great,NA

Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"The balance between listening, reading and exercises",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Everything worked well,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,everything was nice,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,nothing,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,I've been using the pivots before but not as a function,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,IDK,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"I think it was well explained in the text on the website, and I think the exercises we did were good for increasing comprehension of the functions.",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,I can't think of anything immediate.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,illustrating the process incl how to make faults worked nice,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,More hands-on exercises to illustrate how it works,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,One of the best sessions (as well as the one with learning to make functions). I am so excited to go back and make better code for preparing my data frame,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"It was so good, no suggestions for improvement.",NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,structure,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,louise writes really fast and then go to the data/tabel. Keep the code up a little longer,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"Everything. Nice examples, very good, clear and understandable instructor. Alot of eye openers.",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Nothing,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Breaking it down step by step really highligted how there is several to achiving the right table,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Solid pace of the lecture. Fine estimate of time for the exercises. Easy to pick up the pace if you have any problems.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Nothing.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Good practical exercises on how to use it. Good website for explanation,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Sometimes the instructor went too fast but also stopped whenever someone pointed it out.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"I think it was nice to get a insight into pivot, and the possibilities",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,I think it ended a bit too early! I would have loved to use more hours wrangling with it!,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,it was fine.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,I,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Really great to learn about pivot_longer and wider,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Not much,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"It was nice, great to learn new powerfull functions",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,My actigraph data.frame was quite a bit different from the instructor's because the exercise allowed for your interpretation. That resulted in quite a few problems.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,a bit fast,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,both using pivot_longer and pivot_wider,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,talk more about the different arguments for pivot_longer and pivot_wider,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"As always, coding along was very helpul and we were taught very useful things that we can apply right away, which is very nice",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"sometimes it would go a bit too fast, even tho we are aware that its hard to fully grasp at first attempt and will probably require some re-reading of the material, would be nice to have it a bit slower in the moment",NA
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"An excellent session. Again, I felt that I learned incredible much and the exercises were fun and rewarding.",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,I really would not know what could be improved. Maybe we could ask MBK next time if it's possible to open the windows. Other than that I would not know what else to improve.,NA
