Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Honestly, I really felt frustrated about this session. The concept of doing stuff in the qmd file and then delete it entirely was a bit frustrating - we did not get the point of using both the qmd and R file. It was also a bit annoying that we wrote over things we just wrote. And lastly, I think you should make sure for next time, that everyone has downloaded the data correctly",NA

Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","I thought it was a bit difficult to understand as we went along why we were doing what we were doing. It more just felt like a code-along without actual understanding in between steps, and I don't know if it was because we were rushed for time or not. I know it's a difficult topic though, and I suspect that it will make more sense when you're sitting with your own data.",NA

Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"I felt that this session was rushed a little, but I believe we will continue it tomorrow. The session is very interesting, but having it very late throughout the day made it a little more difficult to follow along. Luckily, through the well written syllabus, I will read up on it later tonight at a little slower tempo.",NA
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",.maybe some recap. Take home messages. background for the structure of the functional,NA
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,maybe some recap. take home mesaages.,NA
Day 2,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",The code alongs are great as always,NA
