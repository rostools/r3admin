1,What do you expect to learn from this course and what would you like to be able to do afterward with what you've learned?,"As I am very much self-taught when it comes to R and programming I often have the mentality that as long at the syntax do what I wish of it, it must be perfect. This is especially true for data-wrangling, where I somehow always end up with very messy raw-data.  I hope that this course might instil upon me a more official and simpler way to go about data-analysis (especially wrangling) using R. And also give me some pointers and critique  my not-optimal way of writing syntax."

1,Please describe the problems you've had.,"I already had RStudio open and must have needed to restart it, because it told me it encountered an error creating a new project. All sorted now!"
1,Please describe the problems you've had.,I could'nt complete the New project part as neither of the descriptions worked
1,Please describe the problems you've had.,"I got an promt using the prodigenr package to create a new project where it prompted me to answer no, no, yes. The only problem was that it did not tell me what I answered yes to."
1,Please describe the problems you've had.,"I had one problem: Since I have not participated in your introduction course, I went through it myself. There, I could not figure out why chapter 9.6 “Remotes”: Storing your repository online did not work, specifically applying the Code to copy and paste to link and upload an existing Git repository in GitHub."
1,Please describe the problems you've had.,I just did :)
1,Please describe the problems you've had.,Problems were solved! (1. Could not create a project as described [“Scientific Analysis Project using prodigenr” was not available]. 2. R returned an error when trying to make a markdown doc using r3::create_rmarkdown_doc() ).
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","As of right now I see no areas for improvement. Very well though out! Also, not expecting too much in the pre-course assignment, due to people's existing workload. This was very feasible."
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Cannot think of anything for now.
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Encouragement to open the survey before beginning
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I could'nt complete the New project part as neither of the descriptions worked
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I was a bit unsure regarding the rtool package, whether it was installed correctly."
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I was unsure whether my output from r3::check_project_setup() looks as it is supposed to.This was my first time installing Git and first there was no Git icon in RStudio, which confused me a lot. It appeared when I created my first project. A comment about this would have been helpful :-)"
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I would personally prefer installing the packages and running commands manually using something similar of a R-script file compared to a companion package (R3). This is as I prefer to know what exactly I am doing. Additionally, we ran some functions from the usethis package, without an explanation off the function. I would have appreciated a short description of the functions before having to run them."
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It's super frustrating for non-computer-experts when program/package installation does not work and consequently takes hours. I had issues with updating the package xfun. I needed to delete it from both my programfiles and user R folder in order to finally install r3. Not sure if anything can be improved here, except maybe allow installation of parts of the r3 package and then be able to go back and sort out the rest later. As it is, the installation is terminated until ALL packages can be correctly installed/updated.Also, I couldn’t make this line of code work: prodigenr::setup_project(~/Desktop/LearnR3)It *does* create the project, but not all the subfolders, which causes problems in the next step. I ended up deleting the folder on the desktop and creating the project manually."
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe more helping information such as 'If it does not work try to restart the programme' or 'delete the project and try again'. I spent a lot of time trying to solve errors and the solutions were very simple.

1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Not your side but in general, IT services of all the universities should be improved :). It took one hour for me to complete this easy and clear instructions because I needed to enter my password in every step."
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing that I can think of right now.
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing.
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Pictures of kittens.
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Text distribution could be improved. For example, I created a n RStudio project form the start to later realize that I was expected to create it by specific code typing so that the rest of the functions could work appropriately."
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Think it all worked fine, one small think that I couldn't get to work when I went back and practiced a few things from the the intro course was: when I go back to read the Version control with Git I couldn't find the page you have on your screenshot for figure 8.8 in my Github account - especially I was curious on finding the ...or push an existing repository from the command line code to put into the R-studio terminal. I assume that when we have created a new R project (LearnR3) this can later be linked with Github with use of that code from Github - I just couldn't seem to find it. But I guess we might do this together in the intermediate course."

3,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",?
3,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Even though it is nice with all the information, it was also a bit confusing at times because I was to leave the page, enter a new one, go back to the first and then enter a new one again."
3,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Everything was fine
3,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Fejl: [ENOENT] Failed to move 'C:/Users/au606536/Desktop/LearnR3/data-raw/DataPaper'to 'C:/Users/au606536/Desktop/LearnR3/data-raw/mmash/DataPaper': no such file or directoryI got this error several times, however, i think i've done everythring right, but i am not sure"

5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I have no opinion yet.
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I lost the overview. I was not sure if i was doing it right through out the tasks. more clear, more simple."
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I sometimes got a little confused on how much should be read from the introductory course, but this was minor things. The red dots when running some of the functions also confused me at the beginning"
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It is a lot of jumping back and forth betweens different tabs and it is a little easy to lose sight of where you've come to. If there is any way to improve that, that would be really great."
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",It's a lot of material and I currently have 7 tabs open that relates to the precourse work. It's a bit overwhelming
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe some excercises we can do before the course on storing data and working with zip-files. I am not familiar with the way we have done this in the pre cpurse material so would be fun to be able to do a small excercise after we have followed your instuctions and downloaded the data for the course.
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Maybe some trouble shooting, if something goes wrong? And there is a small mistake download data section. In the last part of this section you show how our mmash.R script should look, but you have forgotten to comment out the # download.file(mmash_link, destfile = here(data-raw/mmash-data.zip))"
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",NA
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",NA
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",No comments here :-)
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","No complaints. I guess it would be easier, for me, if Luke came to my computer and installed the packages for me, but I will manage for now."
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing

5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Se above.
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The only thing I noticed was that the reference to a reading section from the introductory course, did not always match in terms of section number (ex. reference to section 7.1 was actually section 5.1). Hope this makes sense. :)"
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","its a bit messy, when you click on a link, you get to a new website, and need to go back, to continue. It would be better if a new one opened instead."
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",the link to https://r-cubed-intermediate.rostools.org/preamble/#licensing doesnt work
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?","All of it, it was easy to follow and gave source for further reading if interested."
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?","As I already participated in the introduction course, I used what I had learned to make minor alterations to the code in the setup of the project. This is to separate the introduction and intermediate course, and also practice what I have worked with before. This explains my project setup, as I called the project IntermediateR3 instead of LearnR3. With the intro-knowledge I could already follow the structure of setting up the project and connection to Git/GitHub."
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything worked well for me
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",Great that you had an pre-course were you actually had to hand in a task or product. Great idea in order to 'start on the same page' so to speak.
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",I like how the pre-course tasks material is structured.
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?","I like that it is structured, and the how to read the code is very helpful to understand what exactly are we commanding"
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?","I really think it works well the overall structure, as we get an introduction to the code, then the actual code and the expected output"
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?","I think it all worked well, I'm especially fond of the fact that there's really nothing left to confusion, as is so often the case in other courses where you're left to figure out for yourself."
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",I wasn't able to install the necessary package. May be a problem on my end. Will try to troubleshoot before the course
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",In general the structure and information regarding the precourse assignments.
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was a really nice tutorial. It all worked and I learned something along the tutorial.
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was well structured and informative
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?","It worked really well. I got a little lost in the Git setup and did way to many tasks compared to what was asked, but that might be me not reading the directions properly."
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",Nice to be sure all is installed and downloaded before. Nice information load.
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?","No complaints, easy to read and follow along."
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",Task where you have to do the tings you just read about. I like that you show examples of everything - in this way you are sure that you did it right.
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",The codes
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?","The descriptions are nice and thorough, ensuring that everyone can follow along, regardless of their level of skill going in"
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",The detailed descriptions.
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",The guided code
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",The material is very detailed and prepares you for the course as well as you find out what you need to read up on before hand
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?","The step-by-step and elaborate description for each pre-course tasks (including it should now look like this, et cetera) is great for a beginner like me to ensure everything is right :)"
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",The survey is a good way to make sure that we did it
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",The tasks are super fine. It was for me very confusing that the preparation/website for the beginner course was visually such a like. I havent done that course and had to jump back and forth between the two sites during preparation but I find I hard to figure out which one of them I was during (hope it make sense)
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",The website guide is super well thought out and easy to navigate in. Good w the pre-course tasks so setup does not take time out of the course (+ the tasks gives you an idea of the course/programs you will use)
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",Very clear and nice to be able to read up on everything.
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",Very detailed and understandable description of the task
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",Very nice to be able to copy the code directly.. it would have taken huge amounts of time to write the code myself at the stage I am at right now and that would just be frustrating and demoralizing. I loved the step-wise guide to what was needed to be done and where the ressources were.
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",good to make sure that everyone is on the same level. have the right installations. nice that it wasn't hardcore statistic tasks
5,"In your opinion, what worked well?",the syllabus and most of the links work well
