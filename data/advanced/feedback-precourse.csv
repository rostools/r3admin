1,Please describe the problems you've had.,I can't seem to have Git in my Rstudio (and I used to have it)
1,Please describe the problems you've had.,I got a problem with the last code to run r3:::check_project_setup_advanced(). I've deleted everything and runned the script again (3 times) and finally worked out! I also have a privacy error to access https://r-cubed-advanced.rostools.org/content/00-pre-course.html. I've used my phone to download the page and open it offline on my computer.
1,Please describe the problems you've had.,"I may have skipped something by accident but I didn't seem to have prodigenr installed by the time I reached Step 3.7, so I didn't have the option to create a new project type Scientific Analysis Project using prodigenr. This was easily fixed by installing prodigenr etc. Could have just been a me thing!"
1,Please describe the problems you've had.,"Somehow after a security update my git was missing, and it took a bit of work to reinstall it back. But it's back now :)"
1,Please describe the problems you've had.,"Using prodigen command line did not work to set up the project folder, so I need to do it manually by clicking the tabs. Also, the R version I've downloaded is not 4.2.0 but 4.1.1"
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Advanced warning that r3::check_setup() will need to be coped into the survey
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Can't think of any improvements - it works very well.
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","i think the pre-course was fine! i guess the only thing is i did not notice when the precourse ended, so i kept going. But thats more me not paying attention (or the course material being so interesting i did not notice)"
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I wouldn't change anything
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I've had some issues with my internet connection (hospital server), so I initially could not run the lines to access the r3 package (not placed on CRAN). Could be nice to add in the description that the internet connection could cause issues? As soon as I changed the connection to the visitor connection of the hospital, I could run the scripts :)"
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",More detail on Quarto can be given.
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",More R/Coding(Bash/Python) related workshop in the future!

1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing!
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Nothing. One comment, I had to reinstall git because it got wiped when I updated to university software. To work with new OS I needed to use xcode-select --install. I would maybe put this is the notes for people experiencing this issue."
1,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Perhaps it could be nice to have some sort of information that when you use the codes, it does not necessarily show a check point even though the code we should insert worked fine. Example as follow; where the dot is red, which for me is designated that something is wrong or I need to do something more, so maybe just a sentence about that:> usethis::use_r(functions, open = FALSE)✔ Setting active project to 'C:/Users/dkr172/Desktop/AdvancedR3'• Edit 'R/functions.R'• Call `use_test()` to create a matching test file"
