2023-11-10,A bit sad this is the last course in the series :')
2023-11-10,I feel like there in general was to much code-a-long and to few asignments.
2023-11-10,"I think it was great! It was great with the amount of breaks, and also nice that there were no more materials as we would otherwise be brain dead. Alternatively, one could try to apply it on its own projects."
2023-11-10,No !
2023-11-10,"I think this course (compared to the two others) was a little bit messy.. It was a little hard to keep track on all the functions, and their relevance."
2023-11-10,I think the summary parts should be a bit longer to recap what we did to digest the contents better on the day.
2023-11-10,"I would be nice with a bid more code, as seeing error messages and having the instructors to help with them gives an additional layer of understanding for the content for the course."
2023-11-10,"These courses are so amazing. I have learned a lot, and had a lot of fun at the same time."
2023-11-10,Super great course. Will definitely be sharing the links around to my research group.
2023-11-10,"Ideally, I would have liked more time with the recipe/parsnip/workflows, maybe in the form of more exercises. The other sessions were of a very suitable length. Thank you for a really well planned and executed course! You guys are awesome teachers :)"
2023-11-10,"overall a great course. Even if you are not a daily/experienced user, it was not difficult to follow and to grasp the concepts"
2023-11-10,It could be nice if there were more exercise - I got a bit confusing about the functions in section 8
2023-11-10,"Awesome instructors - wonderful atmosphere, even for panicking participants :)"
