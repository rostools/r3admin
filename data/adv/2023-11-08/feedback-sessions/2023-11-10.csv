"Day 3, morning",worked well for,Starting with the recap for day 2 afternoon session,Advanced
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"Build in some ways of minimizing despair! It is SOOOO confusing with the almost-but-not-quite-the-same names for dfs and objects when moving between the quarto code and functions, testing the function in quarto, then writing it into targets. Maybe having some prefix/suffix to the naming to indicate that this is a preliminary name while building the code, which corresponds EXACTLY to the final name used in the function code? Also it is extremely frustrating that the instructor continues when you are working on an issue with a helper, then you are continuously behind and might not have done all steps of the next chunk, which then gives an issue for the next chunk, then you are behind again etc. etc.",Advanced
