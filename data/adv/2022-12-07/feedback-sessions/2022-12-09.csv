Day 2,could be improved for the A general approach to doing statistical analyses,It can be a bit confusing at some times but mostly because of the implementation of new packages that I was not aware of but nothing that could be considered frustrating
Day 2,could be improved for the Creating automatic analysis pipelines,It worked very well considering the amount of information. Maybe this course could be 4 days insetead of three?
Day 2,could be improved for the Networking Activities,"Nothing, I really enjoyed it"
Day 2,worked well for the A general approach to doing statistical analyses,It was a nice introduction to modeling.
Day 2,worked well for the Creating automatic analysis pipelines,"It was a fantastic session, never heard about targets but the functionalities look amazing"
Day 2,worked well for the Networking Activities,I enjoyed the fact that the activity involved going out for a walk. Very necessary after spending so many hours in the computer
Day 3,could be improved for the Efficiently running many models at once,Cut down on the exercises done in class
Day 3,could be improved for the Efficiently running many models at once,"Maybe not as fast, because it is quite difficult to catch up and still understand what you actually are doing"
Day 3,could be improved for the Efficiently running many models at once,Maybe try to write out the exercises a bit more clearly.
Day 3,could be improved for the Efficiently running many models at once,"Maybe you could add something similar to the intermediate course, where we have an opportunity to apply this to our own data/work - It might help to consolidate our learning"
Day 3,could be improved for the Efficiently running many models at once,"Not much, it worked very well"
Day 3,could be improved for the Efficiently running many models at once,Nothing!
Day 3,could be improved for the Efficiently running many models at once,"We were a little pressed for time. A little extra time would have helped, but not a big deal."
Day 3,could be improved for the Efficiently running many models at once,a little too little time
Day 3,could be improved for the Efficiently running many models at once,"i think we were a bit behind, but maybe go a little slower in some places"
Day 3,could be improved for the Efficiently running many models at once,maybe shorter time for writing code / exercises ourselves - it's pretty repetitive so I feel we can do it faster :)
Day 3,could be improved for the Efficiently running many models at once,more case studies for making function
Day 3,could be improved for the Efficiently running many models at once,statistics models running at same time was not well prepared
Day 3,could be improved for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,"Also time. Specifically because the way to code yaml headers etc. is a bit finnicky and it went a little bit fast. Nice that the study material is only, though"
Day 3,could be improved for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,Getting the website to go public
Day 3,could be improved for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,I don't think there was enough time for this. At least I found it very difficult to catch up when it takes some time for some of the stuff to work
Day 3,could be improved for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,I wasn't able to stay in this session sorry :(
Day 3,could be improved for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,"Just ran out of time, and a lot of de-bugging that we could used another day :) .. also more time for customization."
Day 3,could be improved for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,Maybe try to write out the exercises a bit more clearly. Some times the directions were a bit unclear.
Day 3,could be improved for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,Not know yet
Day 3,could be improved for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,The index/default content at the start was a little hard to follow
Day 3,could be improved for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,"Well this was selling point for the course, however it did not work well. I think there need to be better preparation for the material,  and execution, there were several issues"
Day 3,could be improved for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,"i think everything was good.  Naturally ill be going through this part again, to make sure i got everything."
Day 3,could be improved for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,more case studies for making function
Day 3,worked well for the Efficiently running many models at once,AMAZINGGGGGGGGG session. Just what I need for my projects - very very happy with this session
Day 3,worked well for the Efficiently running many models at once,Everything!
Day 3,worked well for the Efficiently running many models at once,Good walk through
Day 3,worked well for the Efficiently running many models at once,How it was structured
Day 3,worked well for the Efficiently running many models at once,It was nice tying everything we talked about yesterday into a pipeline
Day 3,worked well for the Efficiently running many models at once,Most things
Day 3,worked well for the Efficiently running many models at once,Nice examples with an applicable dataset
Day 3,worked well for the Efficiently running many models at once,The structure of the session
Day 3,worked well for the Efficiently running many models at once,We made lots of functions and now I FINALLY understand them
Day 3,worked well for the Efficiently running many models at once,coding with me
Day 3,worked well for the Efficiently running many models at once,"great that it's possible to follow the instructor on the big screen, understands very well the material and nicely communicated it to us. quick help"
Day 3,worked well for the Efficiently running many models at once,it all made sence.
Day 3,worked well for the Efficiently running many models at once,nice tempo through the code along. Nice explanation for the different functions
Day 3,worked well for the Efficiently running many models at once,well the session is great
Day 3,worked well for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,"Cool tools, overall."
Day 3,worked well for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,Good only material and presentation
Day 3,worked well for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,Great to have hands on and see how your website builds
Day 3,worked well for the Publicizing your analyses with a website,I have to leave early today so I haven t taken it yet but I have high expectations :)
