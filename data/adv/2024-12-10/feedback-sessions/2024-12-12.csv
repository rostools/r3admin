"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,A bit more description on how to add the raw data into the folder.. maybe im just stupid :)
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,But also quite intense having to sit for multiple hours on the last date. If possible maybe split out throughout the days.
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,"I think this exercise/project was a little too much to ""take in"". I don't know how you could simplify it or make it a little less extensive."
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,Maybe a bit more time allocated to project work.
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,We found it very difficult to begin the project in our group. We had to search a lot for the codes to set up things. Maybe it would be possible to have a document of all the codes in the appendices (without all the text).
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,"While I appreciated the chance to practice using git, I also wish there would have been more time to try figuring things out all on our own - or maybe some time to try figuring out some pipeline steps with our own data?"
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,Wish we had a bit more time :)
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,"We spend quiet a lot of time on Github and too little time on the pipeline analysis. The github thing took to much focus. For the overall course and for the next time i'm going to start a project it would be nice to have a pipeline analysis/target cheatsheet with the individual steps (do this 1, 2, 3..) in addition to the more ""text-heavy"" website. Just a suggestion. Thanks!"
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,none
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,"Free time, the amount of helpers and the help provided"
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,Fun with the exercise
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,"I appreciated the chance to try out making a pipeline for ourselves. I think it was really useful to run into problems with the instructors still around, so we could get help as we tried on our own."
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,"It's nice to work in a setting that's more open and which is more like the situation you encounter outside the course. It's nice to be able to get help and troubleshoot problems together, so you don't have to solve all these difficulties alone at home."
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,Loved working hands on with the things we learned today.
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,Nice to get to work a bit with it on your own.
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,Really great to get the chance to go through the tasks again with a different dataset.
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,nice working on project
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,Great course overall! It was good to have the opportunity to create a project from scratch.
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,A lot of time is spent on making functions
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,A more thorough walk through of how we can use this in our final quarto docs and how we can present the entire pipeline thing in a research paper
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,At times teachers were not super observant of individuals who needed help (e.g. focused a lot on their own computer-stuff in the back)
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,However a lot of repetition regarding creating functions adding to targets etc. Repetition is nice but can also be too much. Maybe somethings could have been combined and done in fewer steps.
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,I have no suggestions for this session.
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"I liked it, no improvements. (Maybe a 5 min break could have been nice)"
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,I still think target is difficult to understand. Maybe a final summary of what we do with them in the end.
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"I think it would be better to fix the problem with model estimates plot (infinite std.error), so there are no unnecesary questions from students :)"
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,It would be very nice to have a more simple step by step guidelines to follow when trying to apply this on our own data.
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"Jeg ville ønske at jeg kunne få et eksempel på en artikel med en reproducerbar fil, så jeg kan se hvordan det vi lave hjælper mig i den retning. Jeg har svært ved at se hvorfor det her ville være mere reproducerbart end et normalt markdown setup og hvorfor det giver mere mening for folk der skal læse det at alle functionerne ikke er i markdown filen. Hvis reviewer skal kunne følge med, så giver det vel mere mening at have det hele et sted?"
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"Maybe 2 little breaks instead of the 1 ""big break"". Especially if you are in the front rows, it is a little bit more difficult to get some water, coffee, bathroom break, etc."
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"Maybe too long a time was given to complete the tasks, as they were similar to the ones on previous days, a shorter time would have been more appropriate"
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,No comments
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,Nothing
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"Nothing, this had great pace and we were finally able to implement the functions in the target workflow (which is the whole point of this course, I guess) :)"
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,Probably not much for this session specifically
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"Some progress in the exercises, each exercise is basically the same. Aim for creating exercises within ""The zone of proximal development""."
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"Still dificult to see why the exact packages is used, especially the parsnip and the way to build models"
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"Targets is just difficult to understand, but i guess that is just how it is :-)"
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,The usual
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"longer session, maybe some discussion breaks lake the last two days"
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,maybe this greater picture/overview could be introduced shortly in previous sessions as a mentioned in my previous comments for the previous sessions
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,nothing.
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,some of the repetitiveness of making the functions could be moved over a little quicker
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,"Code a long session, some of the things we are doing is starting to make more sense"
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,Everything sort made for sense. Repeating functionals was great
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,Everything worked fine
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,Fint at lære mere om figurer i pipeline
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,Great with many explanations of why we are doing the stuff we are doing (even though it is difficult to get the overview)
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,I liked how we were reminded of the whole point of the session yesterday and we were shown the figure from session 7.3 that illustrates the workflow.
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,"I think the workflow has been nice, and I like the high proportion of code along sessions."
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,It all worked
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,"It was great to continue building on previous knowledge on how to build the functions and incorporate them onto the _targets file. This ""repetitiveness"" is fantastic for knowledge integration!"
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,"More clear, good exercise and pace"
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,"Nice pace, nice explanation of the functionals."
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,Nice presentations and now the use of use and functional programming makes more sense
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,Nice with copy pasting a lot when making functions and not writing everything from scratch.
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,The code-alongs
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,The codealong. I enjoyed the excercises where i could practice on my own.
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,The excercises were well designed
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,The instructions were clear with a good pace and it all kind of tied together.
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,"The pace was quite nice. It was also very helpful that we went over the information from yesterday, and kind of talked our way into the multiple analyses at once. It provided a nice transition."
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,The things we learned yesterday make more sense why they are smart today.
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,The usual
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,"Things are coming together now, and the familiarity helps clarify a lot of the steps"
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,This was for me the most logical session so far. It felt like a nice synthesis of the previous sessions. I really liked the mix of code-along and individual exercises. For me getting the chance to practice in the exercises gives me more confidence that I could figure some of this out on my own after the course ends.
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,"Very good pace, easy to follow and many exercises where you have to think more yourself"
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,"clear instruction, went smooth"
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,lots of coding but easy to follow the exercises due to the guidelines/framework
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,nice to put it all together.
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,"putting everything together, visualizing results"
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,the session was excellent. thank you!
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"End in a more plenary way, maybe by checking some of the projects. Now, people are leaving random and some partners are gone so they cannot finalize the group work. Maybe have groups of 3 and work towards a more final (smaller) product. Time was a bit short for the project work."
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"I think it would be nice to ""save"" the time for a longer brake in another timeslot, since we just had have a long brake during lunch."
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,It would be nice to have the questions in the end of the modules. We didnt really end up looking at them-
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"Longer time for discussion and walk and talk, maybe 20 min."
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Maybe a little more time.
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Maybe some handouts with more detailed things to do could be nice sometimes - but not entirely necessary. It was fine
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"There could be some ""recommended walks"" or other activities."
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Nothing
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,maybe something in a bigger group of people
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,Great to have them after lunch and go for a walk outside. The topics to discuss were great too.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,I loved the workflow we created. I hope I can implement it now for all my projects.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,"It is quite nice to get outside for some fresh air, and have the opportunity to get to know each other a bit."
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,It was nice to be matched with different people on the different days to get to know what others do and what are their challenges
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,It was nice to get to know the other people a bit talking about something lighter.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,It was nice to have a brake to get fresh air.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,It was nice to have these.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,"Nice to get to know new people, mostly we just talked about each others projects, and not so much about the questions."
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,You got to know eachother
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,nice with fresh air and chat about motivations for code
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,Going out and walking a bit after lunches is a great idea. The suggested topics to discuss were sensible.
