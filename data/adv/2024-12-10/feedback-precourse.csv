"In your opinion, what worked well?",All
"In your opinion, what worked well?",All
"In your opinion, what worked well?",As with the intermediate course the pre-course task is very well structured with links to previous topics if needed to recap. Also important to set up for the course. I had issues with connecting R with Github because I have moved to onedrive since the intermediate course. Nice that I am prepared to the course now with everything running.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Easy to follow step-by-step guide.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Errors were nicely anticipated in the text.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything ran smoothly.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything was clear and worked smoothly except the section 3.7 Connect with GitHub.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Everything was fine, except for the issues mentioned in the next question."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything went really smoothly. I appreciate the clear instructions!
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Fast, good not all go trough all again. A explanation in the setup file would be good to have."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I like that it contains very clear instructions on what to do.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I liked it a lot. for the code in nmr_omics.r, I needed to install > install.packages(""snakecase"")"
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I think It was a very clear guide with great support, also with suggestions to solve potential problems."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I think it all worked very well. As I have already done the introduction and intermediate, I was familiar with the structure and spent almost no time on setting up the project and installing the packages. It was easy to follow."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I think the flow in the tasks has a high coherence, and all tasks are well defined with appropriate help to run the different codes."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Im new to using Git and i think the setup if difficult to understand even though I have done th beginning and intermediate course. Can the installation process become more simple for people who haven't worked with git before?
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was a very detailed walk-through of the steps needed for participation in the course.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was a very nice and systematic overview with nice references to the Intermediate course for those like me who need this.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was great to have access to the materials from the beginner and intermediate courses. Being able to review these resources beforehand made it easier to follow the more advanced topics in this course.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was very easy to follow since I've taken the intermediate course and the structure and layout is the same
"In your opinion, what worked well?","It was very well explained, the tasks were really clear to me. Thank you!"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Most of the setup instructions were really good.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Most worked quite well. Had a bit of Git trouble, but I was able to solve it by going to the linked notes from intro-course. I think the most important part is the updated token and syc with R."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Nice with the links for recap of subjects from intermediate course. Easy and fast to complete
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Step by step guidance. The structure of the webpages in general.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The precourse material is generally easy to follow
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The steps are fairly simple and understandable if one had been on the intro and intermediate courses.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Very easy to follow
"In your opinion, what worked well?","it's super clear, very easy to follow"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",-
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",All is good and I have no suggestions.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Hard to say at the minute. I might not realise what I am missing before the start of the course.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I don't have anything specific in mind.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I had difficulties going through the section 9.1 Authenticating with GitHub. Perhaps, I had to have already GitHub account before? After following several links I found this in the Introductory course.But even after setting up my account and completing part 9.1, I could not do task 9.2 Linking your project to GitHub. After entering ""usethis::use_github()"", it shows an error message: Error in `guess_local_default_branch()`:✖ Can't find any local branches."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I had no problems.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I have no remarks to that.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I like it as it is
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I litterally think the pre-course tasks fitted very well to my workflow, thank you!"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I originally had some issues linking my project to GitHub. Turned out I needed to add at Title to the DESCRIPTIONS file. Could have been nice to have a note on that since I have heard of others with similar issues.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I ran into a problem connecting Git to R(Studio), as I did not yet create a project in R. Therefore I got an error when using usethis::use_github(). This might be good to add in the instructions. Took a while to figure it out, but once I created a project it worked. It was explained later on in the instructions, so maybe move this up."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I still find it difficult to understand Git.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I think it would be a good idea to work on the raw data and not just be given the code would be a good idea, since it creates some sort of ownership to the data."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I think it would be great, if a click on a link to another page (e.g., link to Git in the Introduction R course) opened a new webpage instead of going away from the original page. It can be tricky to come back, if you did several clicks."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I was about confused as to where on github the project is stored, and whether we should create a new repository for the purpose of this course. I'd rather not have the files end up in an existing project that I work on."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I work with Luke, so I just write him with problems, but for others it might be helpful with a ""write us here"" option when encountering problems - I needed a new version of pak which didn't work initially, but after checking with Luke directly the problem was solved quickly"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I would prefer that the text were more concise, although I know it is hard. I think those of us who have attended intro- and intermediate back-to-back are helped a lot by this."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Including some video tutorials to watch before the course could help participants feel better prepared.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",It great
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It is a bit confusing to navigate from one link to another, and then to another again. It might be clearer to explicitly state what needs to be done in a specific section and then provide additional reading links at the end to help with a deeper understanding.For example, I followed a link to read about projects and created the LearningR project first, but when I returned to the Pre-course page, I realized I needed to create the project AdvancedR3.Another issue was with creating a project using prodigenr. I had to install the prodigenr package before I could create the project, but I think this step wasn't mentioned in the tasks (or the package did not load with other packages at the beginning).The Authenticating with GitHub section was also unclear. Perhaps because I am new to GitHub, I didn’t fully understand what needed to be done from the provided text.Lastly, I’m not sure why I don’t see the 'gitignore' file in my project structure, although I can see it in the Files pane. I hope this isn’t a problem."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe a more simple installation guide to Git. I worked fine with my Mac but since then I have switched to a PC and i spent some time on it.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Not much
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Not much, I like the layout :)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing comes in mind right now truly.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Nothing, I had no issues."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The email about the precourse tasks was sent a lot before this survey was open and I had something I noticed about the tasks, that was not working properly, but can not remember anymore."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",no suggestions
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",nothing
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",nothing
Please describe the problems you've had.,As described before I had some problems along the way - but I managed to fix them myself.
Please describe the problems you've had.,As written in the previous page. Connecting R with Github because of change to windows onedrive recently.
Please describe the problems you've had.,"Can't remember anymore, but I think it was something with updating packeges or something that I could solve on my own."
Please describe the problems you've had.,Git setup problems and therefore package installation. It was easily solved by revising intro-notes.
Please describe the problems you've had.,I couldn't update the r3 because I had installed a compiled version of pak - when chosing the binary version everything worked
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I had problems with installing and connecting to Git (but your note about administrative privileges helped me and now it works). Also, I went back to learn RMarkdown in the Introduction course, but I could not load the data nhanes."
Please describe the problems you've had.,I have issues with Git and Github.
Please describe the problems you've had.,"I’ve had issues with the installation steps, specifically with the r3 helper package and the required packages for the course. When running:pak::pak(""rostools/r3"")r3::install_packages_advanced()I encountered errors, even after restarting R as suggested. I also tried running:remotes::install_github(""rostools/r3"")but the problem seems to be related to package compilation. I attempted to download the problematic packages individually, but that didn’t resolve the issue.Additionally, I’ve been having trouble connecting to GitHub. It keeps trying to connect using my university alumni account, but I want to link it to my personal Gmail account instead. I’m not sure how to change this and properly configure the connection."
Please describe the problems you've had.,See feedback (error when linking Github to R --> create R project first)
Please describe the problems you've had.,"Well... I described my problem already under the previous question :)Briefly, I could not do this part: Linking your project to GitHub"
Please describe the problems you've had.,"When running usethis::use_github() I get the messageℹ Defaulting to ""https"" Git protocol.Error in `git_default_branch()`:✖ Can't determine the local repo's default branch.Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred."
