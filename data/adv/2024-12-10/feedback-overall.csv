2024-12-12,the last project work was a little chaotic and could be more structured or more people working on the same thing instead of only 2
2024-12-12,"I think it's a great way of learning (going through codes together, group work and individual exercises). Also, great that you prioritize social activities during the course."
2024-12-12,The different steps for setup of a new project are still a little bit unclear (and they are all over the website). Maybe it would be good to have a short bullet-point list at the end of the course with all the steps to remember to check off when starting a new project (and putting it on github).
2024-12-12,"The group work at the end was really nice and gave me a lot. But, it was really stressfull since we had so little time."
2024-12-12,"I would love to receive more follow-up material, that will help me improve"
2024-12-12,you should definitely hire Isabell again - She is the best
2024-12-12,"I like the practical exercise, but we did not get very far due to problems on working on the same file. So more clear instructions on how to do this and what you normally do with the branches would be nice."
2024-12-12,More focus on collaboration in github. we fucked up a lot
2024-12-12,"There could have been more time allocated for the project work. Perhaps we should have set up the project wednesday evening, loading the data and stuff like that :)"
