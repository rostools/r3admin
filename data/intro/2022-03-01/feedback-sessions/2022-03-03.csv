Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,All was good.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Even more time spent here! More customisation of specific figures!
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,I cant think of anything to be improved  besides mayby  the excercise 8.5 was too easy when we could copy most of the codes.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"I don't have any complains, I found it really useful"
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,I don't know
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,I don't know.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Improved
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"Including more analysis for principle component analysis (PCA), PLS-DA, Heatmap analysis and etc, might improve it."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,It was a shame that we were behind schedule so some of the session was a bit rushed
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,May be a bit more time in coding along would have been helpful
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Maybe dedicate more time working on this topic.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,More time to try to create and change graphs.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"Nothing really, it could be longer. Maybe you could add some examples of ""how you we (as teachers) use RStudio in our workflow"". E.g. when do you code in your script-file and when do you ""try it out"" in your markdown file and see the outputs. Do you do a lot of switching back and forth or do you finish the entire code before using markdown."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Nothing to add.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"Remember to show how to put names at X and Y axis. That is important for ""nice"" graphs."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,This session should last longer! :D
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"Whilst I understand that it should be towards the end of the course, with all the basics being taught prior, it might be nice to have more emphasise on them as it is one of the most important aspect/reason for attending the R course"
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,a bit more time to do the exercises
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,even more aspects. Creating your own theme.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,nothing
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,too short
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,was great
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,x
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,A little more time.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Either the assignment was to vague and undefined or we had to little time and to little supervision.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Get a bit more time to finish the final report
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Hmm, I think it's good as it is."
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"I only think that 30 more minutes of project could have benefit most of the projects, but i also understand that the point of the session is just to check if our documents were reproducible"
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,I think everyone should do all the steps. I felt lost many times during the first part when we had to download the package. But overall very great.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,I think it will be helpful to carry out teh donwlaoding of the data part the day before so  the teams have time to look over the data and spend more time today on working
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Improved
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Making the repository on Github ourselves
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Maybe a little bit more time to have something more detailed and logical.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Maybe a little too short time so get much done, since it can take some time just to figure out what to do with data - maybe half an hour could be allocated on day 1 and 2, just to get familiar with the data in a way that corresponds to what you've learned that day."
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Maybe provide a smaller and more tidy dataset, so we don't use a lot of time on this (we can do that at home)"
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,More clear instructions and suggest to follow the steps that are in the book from the beggining.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,None
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Not to much time to accomplish the activity.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Pre-establishing what files and tasks should be performed. Creativity takes time and that is out of course focus.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,The data cleaning requires more experience before we are able to clean it properly and also more time to be familiar with the data. We were a bit confused when the instructors did not follow what was written on the website.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"The start procedure. Maybe it could be describe a little better. Maybe made an easier dataset, so you don not waist time to understand it."
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,We quickly choose the zika dataset and later realized that it was a mistake. The options in the dataset were limited and we spent too much time on deciding the potential plot/table we want to go for. Trying to reproduce data from published papers with simple analyses could be tested also.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Would maybe be fun to start up on day 2 setting up the markdowm and looking at the data etc for an hour and the day 3 we make the asignment.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,short time
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,the data sheet was confusing

Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,"It was a great session, usually I have found pieces of code in google to plot some data and I never completely understood what aes or geom meant. With today's session I learned how to effectively use ggplot :)"
