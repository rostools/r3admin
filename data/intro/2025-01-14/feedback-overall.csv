2025-01-16,Greatly structured course! All the best!
2025-01-16,It was a really nice course :)
2025-01-16,Very nice learning environment and great pacing. I also really liked the coding sessions. Maybe do a more in-depth recap after every session and emphasize the main take-aways more.
2025-01-16,"I think the teachers were VERY good and the webside was just working so well, easy to follow!"
2025-01-16,I wish I could have download the documents other than only online
2025-01-16,Great with enthutiastic and patient instructors
2025-01-16,"Hmm its tough, but maybe do a intro course on R with less focus on Git and then with more coding from the intermediate course to get people started. Then perhaps have a reproducibility course as a prerequisit for being allowed to take the advanced course. Or have some more R coding excersices before the course to understand the basic language concepts a little more before hand."
2025-01-16,tells us to print cheat sheeps ahead of time so we can mark in the cheat sheet what we've tried and which chapter on the webside we can go to for help?
2025-01-16,I would really much like some real examples. Eg. nice scripts from real project -different types. So that you would be able to se how it is done from the beginning to the end.
2025-01-16,Maybe reduce reading tasks and try to have simply group work exercises in between the session without templates to get our minds to think more by it self
2025-01-16,"I think the overall structure of the course worked really well, meaning the rotation between 'reading' sessions, 'coding' session, 'instructor-explaining-stuff-sessions' etc. That helped to keep me motivatet. Greatest draw-back I would say was the physical room, we were in. A window or two would have been nice, but of course I don't know if you have any control over that at all. Thanks."
2025-01-16,Great course in general!!
2025-01-16,"It was really nice but you should include ""Bonus"" info for people a bit ahead of schedule so we can take the chance to try more things if we have the time :) Things you will not cover but are available if we want them. Like little R treats along the way :)"
2025-01-16,"I will definitely use operators more in my coding to manipulate data and ensure clean and readable code. However, a few tasks during course was poorly written and caused confusion in several people. The task to work with "".."" or ""..."" was written a bit too confusing. But otherwise the inclusion of templates, solutions and the general written text was good and easy to follow."
2025-01-16,"As we are typing in and do not always look up, it is important that all the steps are spoken out loud. The r-cube website was good, as was the layout"
2025-01-16,I think there are many surveys forms and it is great but you are required to answer everything. Sometimes I felt like I wrote nonsens when I didn't have anything to report in both points just because it was required of me before being able to submit
