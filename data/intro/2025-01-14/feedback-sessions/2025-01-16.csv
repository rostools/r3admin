"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,A little slow
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,All good
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,I could have used some more options in the visualisation.Maybe having spend a bit more time on showing code for some figures with x and y labels and using different colours etc.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,I think the session worked well
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"In general, I would have appreciated more explanation before we did code-along, because it is hard to remember things when you do not know why you are doing stuff. Unfortunaly, pronounciation of language is a challenge with this teacher, since it is makes it hard to follow and some parts of the teaching. This is not helping my learning. On the first part of the session (Day 2), the talk about logical conditions was started without context and for someone who have not used R, this is quite confusing. It was also confusing that it was said both ""and"" and ""or"" about the ""|"", which is unfortunate when introducing a new thing.  Further, the teaching sometimes continued even though not all green hats were up (=not everyone had finished). A suggestion for the exercises in this part, is to consider not to give away the template for the code (""___(___ >= ___ & ___ <= ___ & ___ == ___)"". It switches the focus from trying to remember how to do it and figure it out yourself, to focusing on to fill out blank spaces with the correct words. The template could be a hint."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"It would have been nice with an introduction to how to figure out the arguments of a function. So if I was to use a function not teached in this course, how do I know the arguments it needs?"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"Maybe expand a bit on the true, false and condition logic in R, as I think this is an important thing to understand - in my opinion the explanation was a bit short."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,More excercises
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,Nothing
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,Nothing for me.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,Nothing. :)
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,Please take some time to listen a bit more to the questions the participants have.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"Text strings and variable names could be explained better. Like when to use ""..."" and when to not use ""..."". When is it considered a variable, like a column and when do we split the variable name. the ""PG""-part"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"The explanation of Logic was explained in a confusing way for those who haven't used R or coded before, This lead to long waits. in addition you have to make sure that you understand what people are asking for before answering them"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,The reading section should have been more elaborated
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,could be nice with exercises without templates too.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,it was ok - i guess i was wanting to now more in depth about how to manipulate date in some specific ways that is perhaps more for the intermediate
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,it workedd well
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,maybe an overview of the used functions?
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"more difficult tasks, maybe some without the ""fill in codes"""
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,nothing it is good
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,the basics of logic was a bit long and I would expect unnecessary
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,use more time on answering questions
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"was a bit fast. teacher should repeat instructions several times, so if you are struggling, you get another chance to hear the instruction."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Good examples using the data
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Good tempo. Good with many repetitions.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Great session. Nice and useful tools introduced. Good teacher!
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"I like that there where more exercises, where we had to try out things own our own."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,I like the tasks in this part
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"I think the part of the function of the mutate,rename and filter is relly nice."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,It was fast to do it and had a great flow
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Many exercises on our own.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Plenty of exercises are fun. Thank you
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Relevant
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,The excersises.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,The exercises were really nice to practice and fully understand how these functions work
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,The flow again was fine and the live coding sessions is ok.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,The functions we are learning are important and I can see how they can be usefull for me.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"The instructor was great, and the time allocated was enough"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,The tasks
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"Very useful concepts for piping and filtering, well explained and lots of time to test"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,a lot of hands on expeience with coding
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,all good
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,everything
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"good exercises, good time"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,good pace and good exercises
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,good with practice yourself
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"good with the helpers. explaining ""why"" as much as possible is good! gives me hooks and logic to remember things by."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,it was a nice exercise
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,it was really good to code along the instructor!
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,nice pace
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"very easy to understand the separation of functions related to ""rows"" and ""columns"""
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,well done. Nice with the exercises!
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,"I would have preferred a bit more guiding in the group project. Eg suggestions to which tables/figures we could make, so that focus would be more on how to use R and Git(Hub) in this setting, and not so much on interpreting a dataset/study I never heard about."
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,"Simpler data to analyse would be nice, since it takes a lot of time to just understand the data itself before you can even start to analyse anything"
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,We could have collaborated more on the project
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,Clear instructions for the project
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,Nice to use the tools we have learned in a meaningfull way
"Day 3, afternoon",worked well for,Nice to work together. Good we were only two. Gives each student more talking time and hands-on exercise time.
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,A bit slow
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,Again maybe if starting by presenting the end result it would lead to some better understaninding of the steps needed
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,"As the codes advance and become longer and more complex, it is really hard to keep up writing them as there are annoying yellow bars with info that cover what the teacher is writing.  Tip: slow down, put in little breaks so that we (I) can keep up, donâ€™t write and explain simultaneously, write first, then explain, write more, explain more, then run."
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,Could have used better explanations of the individuals functions and how they read the dataset such as facet_grid(). Also better critique of which plots to make and why.
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,Even more tools and exersices
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,"I suggest you be a little bit more clear what is is we aim to do/visualize before we start to create the code string (i.e., what kind of plot are we creating, and what do we want i to display). Also, when buidling the code, it would be nice if you would briefly repeat what each function is doing (kind of talking your way through the code as you type it, if it makes sense)"
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,"I think a little bit more ""lets try to remember how to code this plot"" would stress me to remember approach when I get home. For instance how we ggplot. Maybe just explain orally like:when we use ggplot we remember from yesterday that we then need to tell it which geom_ to use etc?Hard balance with enough stress to motivate memory but not too much stress to leave conform zone...."
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,"I would be nice if some of the exercises has more ""levels"". Like for instance: No/little template, full template (as now) and solution. I would like to be forced to think more"
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,It could have been slower
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,It was still a bit confusing and still some challenging regarding understanding what was said due to languagechallanges.
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,Maybe spend a little more time explaining the different functions what are their strengths and limitations. If there's enough time. Time spent solving exercises should be a priority.
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,Nothing
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,Nothing on top of my head
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,"The colour palettes were very similar, so perhaps choose examples that are more different"
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,could be nice with simple cases e.g. for group work. without a template so we can think more about which code to use. if you have an similar example in plenum first you can find inspiration from that code
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,everything was good
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,none
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,nothing
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,overall nice
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,slightly slower going over the codes
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,"sometimes it would be nice to get some more knowledge on how and why the functions work as they do instead of ""just"" pressing enter and seeing something happening"
"Day 3, morning part 1",could be improved for,was great
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Becoming more familiar with the ggplot
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,"Coding together, and then doing excersises on our own."
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Doing the plots ourselves
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Easy to follow along.
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Easy to follow. Easy to get help.
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Everything
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Everything was well explained
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Fun and relevant
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Good code along - usefull learnings
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Good explanation
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,It was good to get to try the different functions of making the different plots and changing colours and stuff.
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,It's excellent to see the beautiful figures to show in the Rstudio.
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Lots of exercises
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Many exercises!
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Nice tools. Good teacher
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Nice with many exercises were we got to try stuff ourselves
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Plotting worked fine
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,Really got a sense of the strength of the pipe function in this session
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,all good
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,everything
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,"good exercises, very good tempo. I like how you consider that data should be usable to everyone."
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,nice coding exercises
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,nice pace.
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,nice to see different functions and actions presented
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,recap from yesterday s session
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,the practises were clear
"Day 3, morning part 1",worked well for,works well.
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,"Again, its fine to tell what you do at each step, but would be nice with more thorough explanations of why each step has been taken. Like why ungrouping is necessary."
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,Even more tools and exersices
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,I still think it could improve if we did group work without the template. But I guess that's what we have to do in next session?
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,"I think the exercises are mostly about copy pasting and not so much writing. There us a huge amount of help but I felt like I just looked for the marked words and copy pasted stuff.I am not a beginner at coding so this might be necessary, I just do not think I am thinking when solving the exercises"
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,"I'm getting worried about what I'll do when I don't have you to help me. Maybe show how to solve issues in chat-gpt, google, cheat sheets.I still am confused as to how I'll manage to break down how to build a table myself without copy-pasting the frame for the code."
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,It was perfect
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,More examples/exercises would have been nice to practice
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,No comments
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,None
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,Not any specific.
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,Nothing
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,Nothing :)
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,Nothing.
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,"There should be ""extra"" assignments for when you are done early"
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,Where do I find more information on descriptive statistics with R?
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,all good
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,it was great
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,maybe making at table that was more usable for what we will actually do with real data
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,nothing
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,really good pacing
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,really nice session
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,"this comment applies to other sessions as well, but I am not too fond of the ""template"" way of doing exercises. I feel I benefit more starting from a blank state, having to recall each step on my own rather than just fill in the blanks"
"Day 3, morning part 2",could be improved for,"would like to know a little more of how to make them nice, or for example turn tables around"
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,Anders is really a great instructor/teacherThe exercises are a bit longer wich is nice
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,Everything worked nicely
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,Excercises
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,Good speed. Teacher was good at explaining sufficiently and taking little breaks when writing code.
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,"Good to have tables covered in a seperate section. Makes things less confusing. Again, doing things together in R and afterwards in an exercise, works well."
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,I liked trying more out myself with good help
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,It was again nice with some exercises to do outself. Also this session was very relevant for the data-analysis i am going to do in my own project.
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,It was really nice flow with reading and exercising afterwards
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,It's very useful!
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,Most
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,Nice tempo of going through exercises. everything is so nicely structured and it is easy to follow.
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,Nice tools. Good teacher!
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,Nicely paced and interesting
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,Rhythm of the session was good
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,"The ""code along"" was good"
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,The introduction before any coding was clear and the purpose was well stated. The content was very relevant.
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,"Very easy to follow instructions, great explanations and good flow within the module"
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,"Very helpful exercises. Good explanation, nice session that was not rushed."
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,"Very nice session! Nice to reach a point where it gets a little easier to ""code"" and visualizing is nice."
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,all good
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,everything
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,"good examples to make it easier understanding concepts, good time to practice"
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,good pace
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,nice recap
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,nice session
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,nice to learn about tables
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,"the code along seems more easier now. Repeatingthe basic steps of style, render and commit"
"Day 3, morning part 2",worked well for,was really nice
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"A bit more simple datasets to work with. The level of coding done in R by the end of the course is very simple but still difficult, and introducing massive, complex datasets makes the task a bit overwhelming."
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"Clearer instructions to get started, like how to import the data and stuff."
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,Could have been nice with more group project sessions. e.g. start with going through some functions and make a group exercise afterwards with more specific task e.g. is BMI>25 associated with glucose levels.l It would force us to think more by ourselves and benefit even more from the course. Especially with good instructor to guide
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"Ended up spending a lot of time on one problem, so a bit more time would have been good. It did take a while to get familiar with data etc, so maybe smaller datasets with fewer variables would be better. Depends on the goal of the exercise"
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"I would have preferred to have more specific tasks, e.g. make this specific figure based on the dataset. In this way we would spend less time figuring out which figure/table that made sense so make (from a data set we do not know) and more time on actually coding in R. I would as well have liked to have a place to see the solutions (as in the exercises)."
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,I would like to get more strict tasks to actually know what well I could do
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"If we had more time it would be nice to have more exercises spread into different days, so instead of being just one afternoon, having a bit everyday and present a more detailed/complex project"
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,Maybe a plenary start with co-coding etc. were everybody made there own repository in Github and also uploaded the data so that all groups were ready to start the fun part (actual project) in R
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,Maybe a project where it was needed to collaborate a little more
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,Maybe group 1 and 2 could send files to each others and give feedback - suggest changes - as a practice
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,Maybe groups cold be slightly bigger so that instructors have more time to assist when issues arise during the project session
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"Maybe more concrete instructions on what to do, it was a bit overwhelming as the data sets were quite big."
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"Maybe the task could be specific to each one ,or it would kind of puzzled."
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"Maybe there should more ""fixed"" tasks to be completed, and also maybe a list with suggested answers. I guess that would just be a summary of the previous answers during the other coding sessions"
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,Mention where to get help (what arguments functions need etc.) in the task description of the group project.
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"More clarity on how to do it, breaken down in steps that makes it easier to follow"
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,More time
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,None
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,Nothing.
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"Perhaps make the tasks a little bit more specific. For example giving a few suggestions on what figures and tables to make. Putting together the code is challenging enough, so it can feel a little bit overwhelming trying to be creative and come up with things."
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"Setting up a project took longer time than expected, as we didnt repeat this action like with style-render and commit"
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,Some suggestion of graph ? or list of ideas of interesting things to look at so we have nice graph that show something instead of randomly comparing variables (sometimes it showed something nice but sometimes it really didn't ^^)
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"Specific focus points in the dataset might have helped. Some specific variables to manipulate and visualize would have been nice to go on, instead trying a lot of different combinations to see what makes sense."
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,The baseline charachteristics table was surprisingly difficult because of the categorical variables and the group_by function. So nice that we went over this at the very end
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"When downloading and linking the data is very new and something I want to learn, it is hard when only 50% should practice the skill in the exercise?"
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,Would like more emphasis on r -coding than Github
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"it was hard to navigate in Git and Github, but I feel like its something which comes when continuously working with R, Git and Github"
End of course,could be improved for the Group Project s,"we had some issues upon creating the project, as we got some merge issues. I think just one person should create the project, and then the other could access it from github."
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,A bit more structure perhaps. Not everybody were timely and commited to the actual excercise
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,A little more time
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"At lunch we just networked and talked together, so I think they would be placed better in between two sessions as kind of a break."
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Funnier topics :D
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,I could have use more time for some sessions to discuss more thoroughly
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,I have nothing.
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"I think it would be better to specific the task for each one,or it could be alitte puzzled."
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"I think the group work worked fine, but I think it would be nice if for the lunch and dinner that people spoke more english by default. I am native danish speaker but I noticed a lot of times people would prefer to speak in danish even though they sat next to someone not speaking/understanding dansih"
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,It could maybe have been a little more active
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,It worked well the way it is
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"Maybe allocated a litte bit more time. But I guess that depends on your group and weather the weather is nice, so you can step outside etc."
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"Maybe in the beginning of the day in stead of after lunch? So you better know the people you sit next to ""the whole day""-"
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Maybe some optional afterwards events.
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,More emphasis to do it. often times the persons from my group did not show up.
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,More organised and not just some talking points.
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,More topics for discussion.
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,No ideas
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Not sure...
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Nothing
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Nothing?
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Questions for day 2 are a bit confusing. It depends a lot on what people is doing in their labs and how do they want to apply collaboration in their groups.
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,The questions were similar to what we were talking about anyway at the coffee machine or lunch or whatever
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,There were a lot of questions on the day 2 to get through
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Those were fine
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,handout briefer question on paper or by short email to be handhelp for the walk.
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,make it mandatory to go outside
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"perhaps it would be nicer if there were certain activities showing what people are working with, so it could be easier to connect with people who are in the same field."
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,All of it - working in pairs and not more people was great
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,Applying what we have learned throughout the 3 course days.
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,Fun to collaborate
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,"Good material, good task descriptions. Two man groups are perfect for this particular type of work."
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,Good to have some time to run into problems and try to problem solve
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,Hands-on was nice. Easy to get help from instructors.
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,Have groups of only two works well. Working in bigger groups would make collaboration hard I think.
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,"I initially thought that we would have several atendees in the group, but having only two teammates was great idea to make us do all the work."
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,I liked the size of the group
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,I think 2 by 2 is a good format because a bigger group would have been more difficult to manage
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,I think it was a nice way to wrap up the course
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,It is good to brainstorm with people you meet for the first time
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,"It was a fantastic opportunity to try all we have learned throughout the course. Great to test Git and GitHub! We got a lot of errors while trying to make it work, but we finally understood not only why we were getting these errors, but also how to solve them and understand the messages"
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,It was nice to see I can do something on R on my own and also with someone else. Great practise of collaboration
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,"It was really nice that we got to work with projects more independently, to practice the things we had learned"
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,"It was really nice. Perfect with 2 person groups, both for support and discussion"
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,"It was so nice to actually try out everything that we have learned. Difficult, but very good foor learning."
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,Just having a lot of time and freedom to explore the code you have learned during the course
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,Nice to practice stuf
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,"So good to get hands-on experience. Nice that it was in the end - during the course, the guided tasks were perfect. Nice to work two and two, so there was a lot to do for both."
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,"The group division ahead. The possibility to work individual in the group, so you could be at your own skill level without affecting the other person."
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,The instructions were clear for the group project and what to do.
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,To do all steps in a project.
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,Trying on hand the coding and getting help from the instructors
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,collaboration
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,having time to do the task. A partner who was patient. getting help along the way.
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,it was nice to work alone and try to do coding.
End of course,worked well for the Group Project,nice to tie everything together and time set aside for it was just right
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,Discussion and the fact that group were randomly define was good
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,Good opportunity to exchange views and opininons
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,"Good sessions to have, because it ""forces"" networking."
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,"Good to have some time to ""formally"" network"
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,Having the opportunity to discuss with people I didn't know before
