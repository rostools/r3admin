I do not think I need further assistance, just my cli version is 3.5 instead of 3.6 and purrr is 1.0.0 instead of 1.0.1...I will try to fix it on my own, but can get there early the first day if needed"

"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,A bit more clear instructions on what you need and some tips for Mac users which are often blocked (or partly blocked) from installing certain packages
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,A little more help to install Git
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,All seems fine to me so far.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,An explanation on how to install Rtools. I think I have done it correctly but with my poor technical understanding I do not feel too sure and that is annoying when it is (as I understand it) quite basic for the rest of the tasks
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,At the moment links open in the same tab instead of opening in a new tab.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,Cannot think of anything at the moment.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,"Code of conduct could be shorter. I understand it is necessary, but very wordy :)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,"Depending on what is taught at the course, maybe you could create some small optional tasks/tutorials on how to use RStudio for complete beginners."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,"Difficult to say, everything is good now:)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,Don't know.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,error debug
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,Everything till now looks fine
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,Everything was quite clear
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,"Everything worked in my hands, I have no suggestions"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,"For me, everything is perfect until now."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,"For next time, you could give a hint on how long time to use on the precourse activity. I kind of figures it must be a couple of days.... (The DDA, at least at few years ago, kind of made you use days for preparing....)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,"For now, I do not know exactly."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,"For now, I don't have any suggestions."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,"Guidelines for installation of Git. I hade to go through a lot of steps. I just choose the defualt setting - and hope this is right. A note on whtether this is what should be done could be nice. And is something else should be done, this should be described."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,"Hard to say, I'm happy with the current form."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,How to install and input the code into R
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,Hvis linket havde virket hele tiden
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,I am satisfied
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,"I cannot think of anything, everything was very clear and well structured."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,I did not think about something to change.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,I didn't get the exact same output in R-studio as in the GIF videos - but it seemed to work anyway. When installing remotes it gave me this:These packages have more recent versions available.It is recommended to update all of them.Which would you like to update?1: All                          2: CRAN packages only           3: None                         4: rlang (0.4.4 -> 0.4.5) [CRAN]5: cli   (1.1.0 -> 2.0.2) [CRAN]--> I selected 2.It was fine to use short GIF's to show how to do - but its a bit tricky to spot what the first step was (since the GIF just continues to run). Maybe a video-player where you can stop/play as you want would be better. (however not a big problem when the video is so short)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,I do not have any feedback for this point.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,I do not have improvements for the pre-course material
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,I do not know - sorry.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,"I do not think this part of the course requires improvement. I did struggle with some installations (in R, of packages cli and purrrr), but as soon as I installed from binary instead of source it worked, I would have liked to see a warning that this could happen."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,I don't have any overall criticism because I think the tutorial was very good. More specifically I got an error when installing the r3 package:Error:                                                                           ! error in pak subprocessCaused by error: ! Cannot install packages:* r3: Can't find package called r3.that might become a problem(?)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,I don't know
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,"I got a bit lost in what I need to read (syllabus, git website, rmarkdown webpage, assignment) and moving back and forth the different documents, but that might just be me :)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,"I guess... maybe the sequence of the content? For example, maybe I need to read Section 4.3 after Section 3.8, rather than before, because I can't check configurations before I set up them...? And when I read Section 3.8 for the first time, there is no Git tab in my Panel C, so I stopped to find a solution to it... Actually, it will appear after creating a project, but this content is at the end of Section 4.3..."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,I had a problem with this commend:> r3::install_packages_introduction()✔ Updated metadata database: 5.07 MB in 12 files.                               ✔ Updating metadata database ... done                                           Error:                                                                           ! error in pak subprocessCaused by error: ! Cannot install packages:* r3: Can't find package called r3.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,"I had already installed Rstudio and even a version higher than suggested, so I figured I could do the installations. But for some reasons, I still needed to update RStudio. Don't know if is was just a bug on my end."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,"I had to install the package 'remotes' prior to starting, which was fine, but it's not mentioned on the page (unless I missed it!). Might cause some confusion for some people who have never opened R prior to this:)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,"I have nothing negative to say. However, just as a heads-up, the Rtools (provided link) version wasn't compatibile with new R version."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,"I have troubles installing Gitlab, It said: These packages have more recent versions available. It it took me three attemps to do it."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,I just noticed that the videos were a bit different from the results I got when installing r3. I thought that the videos might be outdated? But it worked fine :)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,"I know I might have missed some previous information bit I am from regionH, and for me the reminder for installing additional software could be at least 14 days. I have waited a week to get Git and Rtools installed already."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,I might will have like some videos in some of the starting parts
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,"I think although having problems with Git, all the instructions are straight forward"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,I think everything worked well. I have no complaints.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,I think it was a really thorough guide that made it easy to start.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,I think it was good.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,I think it was quite straight and easy to follow.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,I think it's good as it is.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,I think pre-course tasks were easy and straight-forward. No improvement suggestions.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,I thought it was quite well made.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,I thought the pre-course material was more time demanding. Maybe I have missed something.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,I was happy with the current pre-course material.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,"I was unsure whether earlier versions of R could be used (the newest was not available to me as an Region H employed). But got an email answer on that, so all good."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,I'm not sure i have everything installed correct so I don't Know
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,"If the pre-course tasks would be sent earlier before the course date, it would be great because it takes almost a day to set all the tasks."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,In my particular case the following line of code throw me an error --->r3::install_packages_introduction().  This was the error:ℹ Building purrr 1.0.1Error:        ! error in pak subprocessCaused by error: ! Could not find tools necessary to compile a packageCall `pkgbuild::check_build_tools(debug = TRUE)` to diagnose the problem.ℹ See `$stderr` for standard error.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,"In Section 4.3 of the pre-reading (Basics of Git), reference is made to a LearningR R project, which should include files. It was unclear to me whether these files had been made available to us or not."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,"In the beginning I had some problems to be able to solve the tasks, because I needed to download Rtools. This was not described in chapter 2, but after some time I managed to solve the problem using the instructions in R."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,"In the star of the material, maybe a short introduction of what we have to complete (e.g. setting up a GitHub account), would be nice to get an overview. But overall, very nice description of the pre-task and why we are doing them."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,Installing the Git and having it in the R studio software
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,"it is a problem to install/update certain softwares in the work computer and the helpdesk does not help in such short time. In the end, everything turned out to work, but it took much longer than I predicted to complete the pre-tasks. Since this course is to apply to our work, it would be good to consider and desgn the course to be done in the work computer."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,"It was in the beginning a bit unclear what exercises I should complete and what I should save, and what was done in the course itself (e.g., the group work assignment)."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,It worked great for me the way it is.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,It would be good if the material contains a section of possible errors/mistakes during the preparation
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,"It would be good to have more of a walkthrough for the installations and not just links to the websites. Especially during the Git installation there were a lot of different options that one had to go through, and more detailed instructions as to which options would be best for the course were missing. Also, I ran into problems when installing the R3 course package, but was very easily able to solve it (it was probably due to me having had it installed already), so maybe a list of possible errors and easy fixes might be helpful."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,"It would be useful to have more screenshots of the steps when setting Git in RStudio. For example, I cannot find the Git tab in my RStudio and I thought that would create an error when installing the package remotes."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,Knowing if one just fill out the form again given that the course was cancelled the first time
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,"List of participants of the course (incl. institutions), maybe shared by email"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,Maybe a phone number that you could call when all he problems comes up instead of an email adresse.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,Maybe have instructions for what to do if you already have R installed and need to update it?
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,maybe having more pre-course tasks!
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,Maybe just a short welcome video as compliment to the material.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,"Maybe more specifically how to setup Git. It was not immediately evident as to what Homebrew was, versus other avenues,"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,maybe som audio on the small videos could replace some of the text or it could be in addition to the text.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,maybe sometimes a bit shorter
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,Maybe you should include more of the Version control with Git in the pre-course material.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,Messages on the console are not always as shown and it left me wondering if it was fine or not. But the final verification suggests everything is fine :)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,"More detailed information about Rtools and how to link Rtools with R in windows. A video would help a lot. Even though I followed the instructions, I am still uncertain whether R and Git runs as it should - a way to check this would be great!"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,NA

"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,nothing:-)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,Overall I really think that this system is working well.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,Perhaps  more links to prepare for the course so it is not overwhelming the first day. I can't really say at this stage.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,"Perhaps more videos, but I think the material is already good."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,Possibly explaining common error messages that could appear when installing packages and github
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,Remainders of pre-course tasks
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",3,See above
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,Send out the pre-course tasks in good time before Christmas holiday (since the tasks take a while to complete)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,Some linkes were missing (e.g. the one to the cheat-sheet and the internal chapter reference at the end of 3.6:?sec-reproducible-documents.)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,Specific issues in Mac
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,"The amount of reading required, in addition to the software installation, can be overwhelming. It is easy to get sidetracked during the installation process and lose focus on the task at hand. To alleviate this, I would appreciate a section with clear, step-by-step instructions on how to install all of the necessary software for the course. Once that is complete, the explanations and readings can be reviewed."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,The code of conduct was very American style and maybe not that relevant in a Danish research setting
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,The GIFS were cool but sometimes I couldn't tell where the start point was
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,The installation of git was difficult. Maybe could be better explained. Maybe with a video?
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,"The Pre-course tasks could be structured a bit more clearly. Now I started googling and installing the programs on my own, since the tasks started with install these programs and it was only later that I realised there were direct links to the sites I needed."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,The use of a video instead of the text might be a timesaver.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,There is a lot of information on the website and in the beginning it was quite overwhelming and difficult to navigate between various tasks and information.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,There was a lot of going back and forth between different links and windows
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,"There were a lot of different links, opening a lot of internet tabs. Sometimes it was difficult to figure out where to find what. And for those of us with system administrated computers, we really have no control over the versions of R and Rstudio"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,"Timing of the course: would have been better if it doesn't fall immediately after holidays. Also, and taking into consideration some need to travel for the course, it would have been more convenient if it starts on Tuesday of the week."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",5,"To avoid the temptation to skip sections, could have you move through the sections one page at a time"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",4,"When I should install the programme for Git, I was in doubt whether source for downloading the program, I should choose. I was chosen Apple, because I have an apple account. It took long time, but it seems to work."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",2,You can develop a video to explain the pre-course task
"In your opinion, what worked well?",5,After a couple of problems in the beginning I managed to install everything

"In your opinion, what worked well?",3,All in all it was good.

"In your opinion, what worked well?",5,Good introduction to the course. I like the fact that one needed to download everything before the course start.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",2,"Good text descriptions and nice that the codes are included so it can be copy-pasted into R-studio. Good idea to let everyone see what and how to install necessary programs before the course, so we don't spend time on this in the actual course."

"In your opinion, what worked well?",5,I installed everything quite smoothly

"In your opinion, what worked well?",5,I really think it is perfect!
"In your opinion, what worked well?",2,"I succeeded to install all programs, even though we have some problems with administrator rights in the RegionH. It is great to have the gifs with the screenshots. It is also very convenient to have the webpage with the entire program available beforehand. My colleage enquired about the administrative/ R version issues and that was immediately taken up on the webpage."

"In your opinion, what worked well?",5,I think everything worked well. I have no complaints.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",5,I think it is a really good thing to send the material in advance so people can have a first look and prepare themselves.

"In your opinion, what worked well?",5,"I think it was pretty straightforward, though I already had R, RStudio and Git installed, so the parts most liable to go wrong were ones I didn't have issues with.
