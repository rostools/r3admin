2023-01-18,"Would love to have a more advanced course on Git and version control,"
2023-01-18,I would like to recommend to show tools such as the r-graph-gallery.com
2023-01-18,Thank you for an interesting experience!
2023-01-18,I really liked this course!
2023-01-18,"thank you for compiling all the resources we can always go back to when we find problems in the future. I can relate agree with all the points stated at the last session, but perhaps it is not as useful as how to find help in doing reproducible research and increase the awareness and joint efforts in this direction."
2023-01-18,Please let me know for further course!
2023-01-18,"I think the key values from this course is not the coding itself but rather how to do the ""workflow"" in practice since this is not something that you can easily learn by yourself. I would like these stuff to maybe even take a larger part of the course, or a separate complimentary course focusing just on effective, efficient, and collaborative work structures."
2023-01-18,Thanks for a great course and making coding fun! I was really intimidated before this but now feel more comfortable to learn more about coding. :)
2023-01-18,"If it is possible, this course should occurs for at least a whole week for a better experience."
2023-01-18,Thank you for the organization. It was well fitting for what I'll need it for
2023-01-18,"I really enjoyed this course, but running out of time for a particular topic was a consistent issue. I think either the course should be longer, or some parts of the materials should be strategically moved into an additional resources section."
2023-01-18,I am a bit dependent of the tidyverse library. I am not sure on how to find other libraries/which one could be interesting to learn/how to learn about another library (except asking Google... or maybe ChatGPT now :) )
2023-01-18,"Thank you very much for this very well organised course, I did learned a lot and, as a beginner, I feel that I have acquired fundamental skills for the of my carrier."
2023-01-18,"This was great, thank you so much!"
2023-01-18,I'm very glad I took this course. Thank you for running it :)
2023-01-18,I really loved the course and the material in the webpage is TRULY amazing. Thannk you for all your hard work! I enjoyed it a lot.
2023-01-18,Just a general observation - it may feel scary when we try using any tool like ggplot outside of the scopes that we learned especially with a little hard to understand instructions provided on the offical websites.... Thank you for this course and especially for introducing me to Git and Quatro!
2023-01-18,Thanks for everything. Looking forward to the next (intermediate) course.
2023-01-18,It was a great course both regarding study and social activities! I will strongly recommend doing it. I will also try to join the intermediate course to learn more about R. Thanks a lot :)
2023-01-18,"I really appreciate the opportunity to participate in this course. This course was conducted in a very understandable way together with the good exercises that helped me to start coding. Definitely, I'll be practicing it and use the new things that I learned at this course. Thank you very much!"
2023-01-18,Great course in all aspects!
