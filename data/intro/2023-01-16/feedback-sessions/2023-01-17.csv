Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"i need to confess that i didnt update my R during pre-course task because it was written that 4.1.2 was enough in the pre-course tasks (sorry!). but apparently NHANES needs more updated R version, so i had to uninstall the old R and reinstall the updated R (and the R packages) during the course. so perhaps the pre-course tasks should require the most updated version of R.",NA

Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"I think some elements of the Rmd/Quarto files should have been explained more - I helped multiple people who tried to visualize the figure using Ctrl+Enter, and in general the empty line needs of Markdown formatting weren't explained in the detail they perhaps should have been.",NA

Day 2,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,"This session was easier to follow. Maybe due to the ""just do strategy"" above.

Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"Maybe some more discussion on how to use the markdown files for projects. I understand that it can be very powerful, but it does not provide very nice documents. I would have liked to know how to (if it is possible to use it in combination with for example LaTeX.",NA
Day 2,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,Exercises on teaching data set was good (to actually type code yourself),NA
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"Maybe several levels of actually typing code? In the exercises today very much of the code was already written (just filling in missing parts). That's very good to begin with, but maybe I would have learnt even more from a level 2 exercise where I would have needed to provide more code myself. (I do realize time is a limiting factor.)",NA
