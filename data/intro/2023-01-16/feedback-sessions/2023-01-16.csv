Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"Creating learning-github repo (1st repo) ended in nothing. we are asked to try to make a new project in R based on this repo but then are asked to get the token and then use it for LearningR, so learning-github just ends up being unused. Also we are taught on how to make learning-github (repo via github) private, but not LearningR (repo via R) so it is public by default. I suggest including the instruction on making it private explicitly.",NA
