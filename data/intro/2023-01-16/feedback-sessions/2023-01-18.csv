Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"The pace was too fast towards the end. When writing down the example questions, the pace was such that I couldn't really think about the questions, just rush to write down everything necessary.",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"More time would be nice. I would have enjoyed doing some more sophisticated plots, however I suspect however much time you give people will find a way to fill it.Maybe some other data sets that draw people in so its not all squirrels and turtles?",NA

Day 3,worked well for the lecture presentations,Clear and informative.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the lecture presentations,Do not have a suggestion.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,I really liked all the tools provided and the pace at which it was teach.I find all of the exercises very helpful.,NA

Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,More time to explain why we choose this type of code not the other; or why some variables look better on x/y/color. I would prefer to spend more time on different aspects of visualization than on basics of Day 1.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Unfortunately, we've chosen a highly categoric dataset and were struggling a little bit with that (squirrels), but that's on us.

Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,It's good to practice newly acquired skills as soon as possible.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the lecture presentations,Everything seemed okay.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the lecture presentations,Everything seemed okay.,NA

Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,I wish that it could be longer. Maybe showing how to plot error bars or working with replicate measurements and their standard deviations. Surely I can find them in some other sources but still wanted to mention.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"It was a bit difficult to transfer the raw data and clean. If we did not have a good helper in our team, I dont know how we would manage it. Also I wish that we could make some examples of transfering a very simle excel file to R.",NA
Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,it was very easy to follow and I felt confident when I saw some outputs with my own code. It was structured wisely.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the lecture presentations,I think they were really straight-forward and helpful.,NA

Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,the task was adequately challenging and fun to do.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the lecture presentations,"Pace, level of explanations, the continuous help from helpers...",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the lecture presentations,Maybe a bit less reading,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,It was good to code along and try to do many different types of plots.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,As the time is limited I think there is nothing to improve because we covered a lot.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"We could maybe have two sessions of group assignment, one on the second day and the continuation on the third day.",NA
Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,It worked well to start working together and then divide tasks so we could be more productive. And then merge everything together again. It was very good to have the change to practice how to use Github with the members of the team as collaborators.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the lecture presentations,It was a good idea to make us read concept and then to emphasise in the lecture presentations.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the lecture presentations,I think the lectures were very good having the website as a support.,NA

Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,The group project was very good for going through things that we learned during the course.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the lecture presentations,The material was good and clearly explained.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the lecture presentations,I was happy with the material.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,"Like the previous days I enjoyed the code along set up, to actually type in the code yourself is really helpful in learning.",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,It felt like we ran out of time a bit so the later parts of the session content was a bit rushed over. Good still that the material is available online so it will be possible ot repeat/catch up later.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"During the work I was missing clearer instructions on what we were going to do with the data (what results to show in the report), it felt like we spent quite some time trying to understand the data and what variables we could use. But now afterwards I think it was ok, after all the important thing was not to present excellent scientific data but to be able to get something out in a report using the coding we learnt. So maybe the instructions don't need to be clearer, but stressing that whatever you plot or show in the report figures and tables is not important (the exercise is how you get there) might be helpful?",NA
Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,"Really good with an exercise without too much guidance, a good opportunity to start practising on your own. A lot of room to try out things we learnt in the sessions and also new things. A huge benefit of working in a group was that you could get help from other group members, which made it easier for me as a total beginner to get going.",NA
