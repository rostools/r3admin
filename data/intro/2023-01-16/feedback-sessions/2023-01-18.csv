Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,A bit short of time at the end. Felt stressed.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,All good!
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"As I followed along a lot, I am not sure of how everything works."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,As the time is limited I think there is nothing to improve because we covered a lot.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,At times it was a bit quick but Anders slowed down and repeated things when you asked so it was all good
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"Even more practical examples with a whole day only for data visualization, because I think it was the most important part for us scientists."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"For me, the pace was just to high. I managed to write the code as the leader did but no time to reflect."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Have more time to go a bit slowly for each step.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,I think is great the way is taught
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,I think it was very complete
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"I understand that there is no room for it, but if I could ask for one more thing it would be to learn how to customize the pictures more (in terms of font, sizes etc)"
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,I was happy with the content.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,I wish that it could be longer. Maybe showing how to plot error bars or working with replicate measurements and their standard deviations. Surely I can find them in some other sources but still wanted to mention.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"I would have like to have more time for this session so that we can go through different functions such as changing the size of the labels, seeing more about the different color palettes, etc."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"If there would be more time, more emphasis could be put into explaining in more detail how to modify the visual style of the figures."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,It felt like we ran out of time a bit so the later parts of the session content was a bit rushed over. Good still that the material is available online so it will be possible ot repeat/catch up later.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,It was going a tiny bit fast but it was fine
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,It would be nice to see more plot examples
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,It would have been nice to have more time.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Maybe a bit more about scaling things in the graphs and changing colours as we want (not according to a theme)?
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Maybe a few more exercises during this session
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Maybe more varieties in plots that are shown
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,More time on the exercises to actually get to practice what you learned.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,More time to explain why we choose this type of code not the other; or why some variables look better on x/y/color. I would prefer to spend more time on different aspects of visualization than on basics of Day 1.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Not applicable
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Slower tempo to really understand what we were doing.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"The pace was too fast towards the end. When writing down the example questions, the pace was such that I couldn't really think about the questions, just rush to write down everything necessary."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,There were a lot of examples which was good. But I think that it might have been better to have fewer examples and have more focus on understanding the program instead.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,a bit higher tempo
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,could include even more type of plots
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,it was a bit too fast
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"maybe a few more examples to practice, but other than that everything was ok"
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,maybe there could be some more advanced tasks for the ones who have already had a bit of previous experience
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,more content
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,perhaps more tips on how to explore different properties of ggplot. i found it difficult to understand documentation.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,/
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,A few more optional and more specific/advanced sub-assignments
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Clearer ""make one table like X"", ""include X, Y and Z as a figure"" â€“ now a lot of people made the same figures and it took a while to get started with the task."
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Difficult to say
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"During the work I was missing clearer instructions on what we were going to do with the data (what results to show in the report), it felt like we spent quite some time trying to understand the data and what variables we could use. But now afterwards I think it was ok, after all the important thing was not to present excellent scientific data but to be able to get something out in a report using the coding we learnt. So maybe the instructions don't need to be clearer, but stressing that whatever you plot or show in the report figures and tables is not important (the exercise is how you get there) might be helpful?"
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Fine as it is.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Hmm i dont know. it worked well, i think. cannot think of any."
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,I am not sure.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,I think is great the way is was realized
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,I was happy with it. It was challenging which I think was good.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,I was happy with the group project.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"It was a bit difficult to transfer the raw data and clean. If we did not have a good helper in our team, I dont know how we would manage it. Also I wish that we could make some examples of transfering a very simle excel file to R."
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"It was hard to set the barrier of how hard to make it for ourselves, but I guess that's individual and nothing you can do anything about."
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,It would be great to have small challanges on what to visualize?
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,It would have been nice with an introduction to the task from the teachers.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Maybe assigning bthe type of data by the lecturers beforehand so not all the group have the same dataset would make it more fun
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Maybe increase the need to interact with the other member of the team
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Maybe set an expectation of how much should be done per person/as a group. We understand one table and at least one figure per person
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,More time or maybe coordinate the different projects and assign them to the group. More time to look through each group's files so the whole class can see the different types of plots that are possible/get more ideas for how to plot data
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"More time would be nice. I would have enjoyed doing some more sophisticated plots, however I suspect however much time you give people will find a way to fill it.Maybe some other data sets that draw people in so its not all squirrels and turtles?"
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,No comments
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Nothing.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Perhaps a bit more detailed which figures we should do. On the other hand the freedom was also nice
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Probably more time to perform the groups assignment, and topic distribution so that it was something more than turtles and squirrels haha"
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Really short on time. Data set was ""broken"" and had to be fixed and it took a lot of time"
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,That it is clear to everyone that they have to finish within the time....but I think it was though..
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"The instructions for how to get started were a bit confusing, which caused delays in getting started. This issue compounded on the fact that the amount of time we had was very short."
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Unfortunately, we've chosen a highly categoric dataset and were struggling a little bit with that (squirrels), but that's on us. Also, it wasn't easy for me to work in this way because it's hard to trust other people coding skills and wait for them to provide their parts. But that's something I discovered today ; )"
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"We could maybe have two sessions of group assignment, one on the second day and the continuation on the third day."
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,a bit higher tempo
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,all good!
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,maybe let everyone have their name on final report
