"In your opinion, what worked well?",Very well described
"In your opinion, what worked well?",easy to follow along

I did struggle with some installations (in R, of packages ""cli"" and ""purrrr""), but as soon as I installed from binary instead of source it worked, I would have liked to see a warning that this could happen."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I don't have any overall criticism because I think the tutorial was very good. More specifically I got an error when installing the r3 package:Error:                                                                           ! error in pak subprocessCaused by error: ! Cannot install packages:* r3: Can't find package called r3.that might become a problem(?)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I guess... maybe the sequence of the content? For example, maybe I need to read Section 4.3 after Section 3.8, rather than before, because I can't check configurations before I set up them...? And when I read Section 3.8 for the first time, there is no Git tab in my Panel C, so I stopped to find a solution to it... Actually, it will appear after creating a project, but this content is at the end of Section 4.3..."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I had a problem with this commend:> r3::install_packages_introduction()✔ Updated metadata database: 5.07 MB in 12 files.                               ✔ Updating metadata database ... done                                           Error:                                                                           ! error in pak subprocessCaused by error: ! Cannot install packages:* r3: Can't find package called r3.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I have nothing negative to say. However, just as a heads-up, the Rtools (provided link) version wasn't compatibile with new R version."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I might will have like some videos in some of the starting parts
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think everything worked well. I have no complaints.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think pre-course tasks were easy and straight-forward. No improvement suggestions.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I thought it was quite well made.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I was happy with the current pre-course material.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","In Section 4.3 of the pre-reading (Basics of Git), reference is made to a LearningR R project, which should include files. It was unclear to me whether these files had been made available to us or not."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",In my particular case the following line of code throw me an error --->r3::install_packages_introduction().  This was the error:ℹ Building purrr 1.0.1Error:        ! error in pak subprocessCaused by error: ! Could not find tools necessary to compile a packageCall `pkgbuild::check_build_tools(debug = TRUE)` to diagnose the problem.ℹ See `$stderr` for standard error.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",It worked great for me the way it is.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It would be good to have more of a walkthrough for the installations and not just links to the websites. Especially during the Git installation there were a lot of different options that one had to go through, and more detailed instructions as to which options would be best for the course were missing. Also, I ran into problems when installing the R3 course package, but was very easily able to solve it (it was probably due to me having had it installed already), so maybe a list of possible errors and easy fixes might be helpful."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It would be useful to have more screenshots of the steps when setting Git in RStudio. For example, I cannot find the Git tab in my RStudio and I thought that would create an error when installing the package remotes."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe just a short welcome video as compliment to the material.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",No idea
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing it comes to my mind.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing that I can think of right now that would significantly improve things. It worked well as it is for me.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing to add
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Overall I really think that this system is working well.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Perhaps more videos, but I think the material is already good."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Possibly explaining common error messages that could appear when installing packages and github
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Send out the pre-course tasks in good time before Christmas holiday (since the tasks take a while to complete)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Some linkes were missing (e.g. the one to the cheat-sheet"" and the internal chapter reference at the end of 3.6:?sec-reproducible-documents.)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The ""Pre-course tasks"" could be structured a bit more clearly. Now I started googling and installing the programs on my own, since the tasks started with ""install these programs"" and it was only later that I realised there were direct links to the sites I needed."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The amount of reading required, in addition to the software installation, can be overwhelming. It is easy to get sidetracked during the installation process and lose focus on the task at hand. To alleviate this, I would appreciate a section with clear, step-by-step instructions on how to install all of the necessary software for the course. Once that is complete, the explanations and readings can be reviewed."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",The use of a video instead of the text might be a timesaver.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Timing of the course: would have been better if it doesn't fall immediately after holidays. Also, and taking into consideration some need to travel for the course, it would have been more convenient if it starts on Tuesday of the week."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","To avoid the temptation to skip sections, could have you move through the sections one page at a time"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","it would be nice if the pre-course tasks for example, could be put in ordered numbers instead of trying to find the tasks embedded in the text"

What do you expect to learn and what would you like to be able to do with what you've learned?,"I would like to learn what R can be used for and how to choose the right tools for my analyses, and how to make sure that me or my collegues will be able to use it after some time in a right way (being able to track every step of the analysis). I would also like to improve the speed of my analysis, which currently mainly involves CellProfiles, Excel and GraphPad, possibly by exchanging the latter two (or at least Excel) with R."
What do you expect to learn and what would you like to be able to do with what you've learned?,I would like to utilize R to analyze multidimensional data.
What do you expect to learn and what would you like to be able to do with what you've learned?,"I'm hoping to learn some basics in modern programming (or fresh up the minor and ancient knowledge I have), and to learn the basics in using R and RStudio. Having learnt that I hope to be able to use these tools to do basic analysis such as sorting and extracting information from the output files I get from the analysis tools already in place in our group. Hopefully my new knowledge will also give me a better understanding of the analysis tools we are using."
What do you expect to learn and what would you like to be able to do with what you've learned?,"Improve my overall foundation in R language, particularly utilisation of tidyverse packages and version control with Git. Tidyverse packages including ggplot2 would be especially useful for data visualisation in my own research."
