"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,a little bit faster progress,Introductory
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Code along is very nice. The tempo was quite good as well,Introductory
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"Maybe be more specific to translate the functions/inputs to words e.g., ""now i am telling R to use Y function in X package because ... """,Introductory
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"The tempo, very easy to follow, while also leaving time for individual reflection/memorizing/notetaking. Great to actually see the various functions performed, and what they do, instead of them just being quickly mentioned.",Introductory

"Day 2, morning",worked well for,The data wrangling parts were very useful,Introductory
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"I don't think the TRUE & TRUE, TRUE & FALSE etc. examples were very illustrative, however this is coming from someone who already understands these concepts so maybe it's just me, but i almost got more confused. I think examples using ""real"" data would be better as using TRUE and FALSE is expecting people to understand these ""programming"" concepts in the first place. Like show examples using the NHANES dataset from the get go and change the operator to see how the output changes",Introductory

"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Maybe include more exercises to apply the learnings.,Introductory
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,It is important with loud and clear communication and perhaps meta-communication just to make sure everybody understands what we are doing. Maybe a good idea to summerize after a coding-session and not only at the end.,Introductory
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"a lot of praticing ""together""",Introductory
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,not very well explained - often we were told to just type som text/code but not really explained why/what the different parts of it meant.,Introductory
