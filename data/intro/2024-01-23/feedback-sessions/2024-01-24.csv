"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,...
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,A bit more practice could be nice.
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,Git and github is still confusing
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"I find that there was too much reading, and I'd prefer more teaching to change it up a bit."
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,I missed a little bit of overview and bit by bit taking me through Git and how it works with RStudio.
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,I think it has been adequate.
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"I would have preferred that we re-do the exercises (with the instructor on the big screen) after doing them on our own, to make sure we did them the right way"
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"It should might have been a bit more code along on the ""committing"" part, because a lot of people are afraid to do it in the wrong way."
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,It was overall perfect for me. was more practical and easy to work along.
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,Just a slower )
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,Maybe a bit too much reading in this session - would be fine with a small presentation in the start maybe.
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"Maybe a demonstration that is a bit more ""context-oriented"". Maybe one instructor could make changes from his computer, and upload to GitHub, and then another instructor could open from his computer. Visually conveying the context for using Git and Github."
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,Maybe go through with the students how to make github connected to your local project instead of just reading and setting it up yourself I think that would solve some confusion.
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,Maybe how you could use word files and github
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,Put more of this session into the pre-course assignments. Just let people read all of chapter 6.
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"Reading section 6.1 and 6.2 is fine, but time spend going through these in class could be shortened a bit."
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"The thing with getting git to work with github was not explained but a reading assignment.. it was actually the most complicated part, so I recommend to do in the group. Because there is some links to guis on the assignment , I was confused of how much i should read in to it."
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,Too many reading exercises late in the afternoon. More collaborative exercises would be nice.
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"Too short time after lunch to the 'networking/discussion part' - we all got back too late after lunch, more time to walk-and-talk would be nice. It was a long afternoon with a lot of waiting time."
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,a little bit too slow
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,"if people are fast, could be nice to get extraaaa tasks as optional"
"Day 1, afternoon",could be improved for,nope
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"A nice and thorough introduction to Git and GitHub, with good examples. Great with frequent small breask as it also was a bit tiring, mostly due to a lot of waiting time."
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Ample time to read and fix problems with code
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"Clear instructions on how to use git and github for beginners, the exercises helped to have a clearer idea about the proccess"
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Everything.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Fine introduction to Git and GitHUb.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Going through the steps to connect to GitHub by our selves - and repeating some this morning.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Good exercises - easier to understand when you get to use it.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Good explanation of the line of thought.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Good explanations of how you can work together on a project. Nice that you take it so slow :D
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Great introduction to Git and Github. Fine tempo. Nicely explained
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,It was a very clear explanation of git and github and the amount of repetition of each step in commiting and pushing was good.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Learning how to use git and connect to github in a nice pace.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Practicing committing changes in Git was useful. The reading was also very clear.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Provided a good understanding of the difference between Git and GitHub and the practical help in getting these coupled together.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"Setting up git, and connecting to GitHub section was really structural and good."
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,Stickers and exercises
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,The readings and the instructions were well-synced and easy to follow.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,The sticker are very nice. Simple but effective.
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,The structure for the course was very well performed and the understanding of why it is important to use Github
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"The way of going through Git & Github. It is difficult to comprehend, so breaking down the lesson into smaller pieces at a time worked really well!"
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"Very good explanations in the online written text. Hard to understand, but helped with the illustrations."
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,changing between reading and practicing ourselves
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,implementing theory with hands on exercises
"Day 1, afternoon",worked well for,"work with Git was complicated, but it was great performence and explanations"
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,- Could have used one more break  (before lunch time)- Clearer communication with the instructor
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Better communication
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"I don't think the TRUE & TRUE, TRUE & FALSE etc. examples were very illustrative, however this is coming from someone who already understands these concepts so maybe it's just me, but i almost got more confused. I think examples using ""real"" data would be better as using TRUE and FALSE is expecting people to understand these ""programming"" concepts in the first place. Like show examples using the NHANES dataset from the get go and change the operator to see how the output changes"
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,I think the session's content was adequate.
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,It is important with loud and clear communication and perhaps meta-communication just to make sure everybody understands what we are doing. Maybe a good idea to summerize after a coding-session and not only at the end.
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Maybe a bit more explanation of the functions in the code-along
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"Maybe a bit more of the longer exercises, to enhance understanding. But only a few more (1 or 2)."
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"Maybe be more specific to translate the functions/inputs to words e.g., ""now i am telling R to use Y function in X package because ... """
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Maybe explain more in depths why the here() function is smart
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Maybe include more exercises to apply the learnings.
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Maybe one more exercise that you can try to solve on your own.
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Maybe speed up just a little bit. Long session with lots of similar exercises. (but I know it's difficult to do a pace that fits all)
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"Maybe the functions could be explained a little more along with why they are actually useful and when. More explaining down to earth and concise with the data, less ""write along"". More exercises, if there is time."
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"More facilitated time to talk with your side-buddy. We benefitted greatly from talking, but were only able to do so shortly."
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,The explanations could have been clearer to some questions.
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"The instructor was a bit insecure, the session progressed a little slow"
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"The teacher mostly re-read, what we just read, out loud instead of elaborating it by giving examples or refrasing."
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"Went just a notch too fast. Im new to coding, so could be the reason."
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Would be nice to have the question/problem clearly stated before writing the code that solves it. (e.g. The task: you need to select only entries for diabetics from the dataset. This is how this is done with a corresponding filtering function).
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,Would have been nice with some examples illustrating the difference between the & and | commands - also how easily it can go wrong.
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,a little bit faster progress
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,cannot think of anything at the moment.
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,not very well explained - often we were told to just type som text/code but not really explained why/what the different parts of it meant.
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,"perhaps, more exercises can be done by ourself. but it was a good start"
"Day 2, morning",could be improved for,task verification together
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,A lot of interactive coding exercises.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Code along is fine.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Code along is very nice. The tempo was quite good as well
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Combination of code-along and reading - and very good exercises
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"Covered the main steps needed to start with R project with examples for every function to practice, which helped understanding the process and made it easier to get used to coding in R"
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Everything worked just fine.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Exercises
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"Many good functions presented, nice to work with R. Very nice with exercises!!"
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Nice structure and information was given in an order that was intuitive and made sense. The exercise about chaining the functions using pipes was fun.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,That is was showcasing what to do while typing the code
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,The data wrangling parts were very useful
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,The exercises were good and nice repetition with using the pipe function.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,The exercises where we had to apply and combine some of the learnings from the session.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,The exercises. More of those! :-)
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,The fact that there was more programming in this section.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"The subjects/structure, the tasks and the explanations/text written on the website"
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"The tempo, very easy to follow, while also leaving time for individual reflection/memorizing/notetaking. Great to actually see the various functions performed, and what they do, instead of them just being quickly mentioned."
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"This part was really confusing, the teacher did not explain much about what we were doing."
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,Very interactive. Nice coding exercises.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"Was very informative, challenges were easily resolved with help. The session was clear."
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,a lot of hands on and good explanations in the reading material
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,"a lot of praticing ""together"""
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,it was a very good practice to try tidyverse.
"Day 2, morning",worked well for,visualization
