2024-01-25,I liked it! It is how a modern course should be. Well done team!
2024-01-25,"This is a fantastic course! Above all (learning, applying what I learned), this was super fun! I will highly encourage my friends and colleagues to attend this series of courses. Thank you for the instructors for the good time, the knowledge, and the good laughs."
2024-01-25,"All in all an amazing course!Only one minor thing was, that one of the instructors seemed a bit unprepared and was very quiet/didn't say much during the session when showing the code."
2024-01-25,"I liked the reading tasks, but some days (e.g. day one) I think some of the reading tasks could be replaced with a presentation. But minor comment... I really liked the course. See you at intermediate :)"
2024-01-25,It is truly a great course! Keep doing what you are doing!
2024-01-25,It was a really meaningful course
2024-01-25,It was very good!
2024-01-25,one of the instructors was a bit difficult to understand.But overall very good and patient instructors
2024-01-25,"In general a very good course! The session 2nd day morning had some issues for me, it was a lot of just writing what the teacher wrote and not actually explaining what and why. All other sessions were easy to follow. Maybe there could have been added even more exercises as I found these very giving. Maybe also after we were finished to practice at home. The hotel, food, coffee and everything like that was great. Thank you for a great course!"
2024-01-25,Thank you very much for a great course!
2024-01-25,"Those of us who traveled from `other countries like Germany, could have been allowed to stay the last day at the hotel, this way we don't have to travel back immediately after a long day session."
2024-01-25,I would prefer more coding-along and less reading tasks.
2024-01-25,all was really nice. the course material seemed to be arranged so well and there was a good structure. Looking forward to participating to next courses :)
2024-01-25,thank you very much for the course
