1,Day 3,I really liked the course and the structure of it but I would include more exercises to do after the course. And I think the instructors and helpers were really important to understand and solve problems in the course
1,Day 3,Awesome course! Great job to all instructors. Look forward to the advanced course. ;-)
1,Day 3,NIL - Was my favourite course I've taken so far! Thank you so much
1,Day 3,thanks
1,Day 3,More time for group project work.
1,Day 3,Having more pre-course materials to read helps a lot :)
1,Day 3,"Please, check the light and slides as I could not follow most of the presentation due to imbalance in light (two bright to show the slides).Please, increase the time for the group work as we had to jam different activities and more time will enable deeper understanding of the coding process."
1,Day 3,"It will be great if there is more time for the team work, we will be able to finish more work, and mimic the project in real life. The instructor and the helpers are super helpful, and study environment is also great."
1,Day 3,I think have more time for coding will be fun. Maybe with a reference allowing to spend more time doing plots or data clean up
1,Day 3,"From my perspective we have used too musch time in other programs than R, but it might come in handy in the future. Would have been nice though with a bigger focus on R"
1,Day 3,Very good with a three days course to cover the topics
1,Day 3,I could have used a bit more R-code on how to load data and basic things in RWe could in genereal have used a bit more time for the group work. It could be an idea to assign the groups a dataset to work with so we didn't have to spend time on that.It worked well to have three days in a row.
1,Day 3,"I liked the course a lot .I know this is not a statistical course, but it would have been nice to learn to do a few simple statistical analysis (instead of just doing figures). For instance a linear or logistic regression, a t-test or something and learning how to save them in a nice table.Instead of showing so many figures (which took quite a long time, you could go more into detail with one figure and the options. Could use a cookbook for how you start to work - save your data to r-format, load in data and then a simple analysis. We used the NHANES data a lot, but that was already there.Our data for the group work was not good - would be nice if you could provide a dataset, if groups cannot find them within a reasonable amount of time."
1,Day 3,"I am not sure if it is something applicable in an introduction course but I would like to learn how to handle datasets comprise of more than one file such as gene expression datasets etc. I would like to learn how to handle separate files together which would be something that I can use right away. Besides all the minor points, I appreciate time and effort of the organizers and instructors. It was a wonderful course and I really benefited from it. It was also very nice to meet with nice people. Thanks a lot!"
1,Day 3,"I felt there wasn't enough time to do the project. It became a bit confusing with creating a project individually and them link it to GitHub, so a suggestion could be to have the project management session directly followed by the Git session. Maybe we would not use R the first day, but this course is about more than R. Overall, it was a great course anyway!"
1,Day 3,i forgot the data loading from the first day by the time that we needed it for the assignment. would be good to have a recap in the mornings
1,Day 3,"Group assignment was stressfull  with ragrsds to time, noise and romm temperature"
1,Day 3,Say that we should work in separate RMarkdown files for the group assignment
1,Day 3,"All instructors were really great and seemed very committed to teaching us how to use R and encoruinging us to be open and honest about the science that we will do in the future. Please send me the dates for a now intermediate course when you have planned it, I would very much like to attend"
1,Day 3,"I thought it was a really great intro. I think when you sign up you should be already encouraged to do two courses because three days is simply not enough to get through enough material to be able to go back and do this on your own, confidently."
1,Day 3,Keep on doing a good job. I would love to have more statistic in the course. Just do a simple t.test but we do not have that much time
1,Day 3,"Super useful course, great instructors. Some days were a little long, but I think it finished off great with the challenge, and it was great to try to implement what we have learned as a group. Perhaps there could be a few breaks from sitting in front of a screen somehow (maybe an energizer? or a little walk around a building talking about some concepts?) just to freshen things up. Otherwise great and I will highly recommend it to anyone :)"
1,Day 3,It was a great course and I would highly recommend it to my beginner colleagues. I have had a great time.
1,Day 3,"Great course! As already mentioned to some instructors, a bit more of a basic introduction (could be provided in pre-course material) would be great. e.g. what is a script/code/package etc."
1,Day 3,"Perhaps more introduction to R in pre course material for those, who haven't worked with R or other coding programs before. Perhaps some introduction videos, that would have to be watched before the start of the course."
1,Day 3,"A bit more step-by-step guidance for the group work. It was a good task - but I liked, that It didn't last for longer than the last day."
1,Day 3,"It has really been a great course and I like how everything is summed up in the final exercise. With regard to the exercise, we could have benefited from a short joint introduction. Furthermore, the initial part of the exercise involved one person working on a computer without the rest of the group being able to see the screen. If possible, could each group get a separate meeting room where we can share the screen of the person typing. Or could we use a zoom meeting, where the screen can be saved? Other than that, everything was good."
1,Day 3,"Maybe a bigger projector screen would be nice? Even though everything is written in the course material, sometimes the code written by the instructor can be a little bit different. Or if new code is typed in (e.g. following a question) it can be really hard to see it. Maybe a bit more comprehensive introduction of the git interface would be nice."
1,Day 3,I think it has been a great course!
1,Day 3,"About the team exercise on day 3 - the idea is great and very useful, but I really think that a short introduction to what is expected and how to start working together would have been needed to get the maximal benefit of the exercise. Eg. pointing out that it is not smart to work in the same document all at once to avoid having merge problems all the time would have been nice. But all in all, a useful exercise :)"
1,Day 3,Amazing work making R accessible for beginners. Thanks for the course :)
1,Day 3,Was a great course! :) Suggestion could be to include some additional material/exercises for researchers that are a bit more experienced
1,Day 3,I want to thank DDA and the instructors for offering such a great course. Looking forward to participate in intermediate course.
1,Day 3,"Better time management. Otherwise, great job! And thank you!"
1,Day 3,"Please, remember to put ""Energizers"" in to the program. We are sitting a lot with one-way-communication."
1,Day 3,a minor comment but may be the tables and chairs height could be adjusted
1,Day 3,The course was recommended by my officemate who participated in last year and I also will highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in using R and does not have that much knowledge on it like me :)
1,Day 3,Can we make it 4 days!! :D
1,Day 3,"The instrcutors are amazing, very patient and cheerful to us. I hope in the follow up intermediate class we will learn more on the packages for, genome alignment, and more case studies and exercise for coding muscle traininng. Thank you all."
2,Day 3,"Would love to have a more advanced course on Git and version control,"
2,Day 3,I would like to recommend to show tools such as the r-graph-gallery.com
2,Day 3,Thank you for an interesting experience!
2,Day 3,I really liked this course!
2,Day 3,"thank you for compiling all the resources we can always go back to when we find problems in the future. I can relate agree with all the points stated at the last session, but perhaps it is not as useful as how to find help in doing reproducible research and increase the awareness and joint efforts in this direction."
2,Day 3,Please let me know for further course!
2,Day 3,"I think the key values from this course is not the coding itself but rather how to do the ""workflow"" in practice since this is not something that you can easily learn by yourself. I would like these stuff to maybe even take a larger part of the course, or a separate complimentary course focusing just on effective, efficient, and collaborative work structures."
2,Day 3,Thanks for a great course and making coding fun! I was really intimidated before this but now feel more comfortable to learn more about coding. :)
2,Day 3,"If it is possible, this course should occurs for at least a whole week for a better experience."
2,Day 3,Thank you for the organization. It was well fitting for what I'll need it for
2,Day 3,"I really enjoyed this course, but running out of time for a particular topic was a consistent issue. I think either the course should be longer, or some parts of the materials should be strategically moved into an additional resources section."
2,Day 3,I am a bit dependent of the tidyverse library. I am not sure on how to find other libraries/which one could be interesting to learn/how to learn about another library (except asking Google... or maybe ChatGPT now :) )
2,Day 3,"Thank you very much for this very well organised course, I did learned a lot and, as a beginner, I feel that I have acquired fundamental skills for the of my carrier."
2,Day 3,"This was great, thank you so much!"
2,Day 3,I'm very glad I took this course. Thank you for running it :)
2,Day 3,I really loved the course and the material in the webpage is TRULY amazing. Thannk you for all your hard work! I enjoyed it a lot.
2,Day 3,Just a general observation - it may feel scary when we try using any tool like ggplot outside of the scopes that we learned especially with a little hard to understand instructions provided on the offical websites.... Thank you for this course and especially for introducing me to Git and Quatro!
2,Day 3,Thanks for everything. Looking forward to the next (intermediate) course.
2,Day 3,It was a great course both regarding study and social activities! I will strongly recommend doing it. I will also try to join the intermediate course to learn more about R. Thanks a lot :)
2,Day 3,"I really appreciate the opportunity to participate in this course. This course was conducted in a very understandable way together with the good exercises that helped me to start coding. Definitely, I'll be practicing it and use the new things that I learned at this course. Thank you very much!"
2,Day 3,Great course in all aspects!
