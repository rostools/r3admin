2,Please describe the problems you've had.,"I was installing GIT on my lap top, and I had to take different decisions about the required installation files, which I did not know about. A colleague helped me, but I am still not sure if have taken the right decisions. Hope that I will encounter no problems during the course."
2,Please describe the problems you've had.,It took me three times to install Gitlab. It said: These packages have more recent versions available. And at the end of the process it gave me errors
2,Please describe the problems you've had.,Please have a look at my previously answer
2,Please describe the problems you've had.,"we don't have administrator rights on the work computers in RegionH, so all programs need to be installed via the software/ computer center of the Region. they add requested programs to the  softwareshop upon request, but that takes quite some time since they need to be checked for saftety. It is meant to help protect patient data but can make installing programs very slow."
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",...
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Code of conduct could be shorter. I understand it is necessary, but very wordy :)"
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Guidelines for installation of Git. I hade to go through a lot of steps. I just choose the defualt setting - and hope this is right. A note on whtether this is what should be done could be nice. And is something else should be done, this should be described."
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Hvis linket havde virket hele tiden
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I am satisfied
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I cannot think of anything, everything was very clear and well structured."
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I didn't get the exact same output in R-studio as in the GIF videos - but it seemed to work anyway. When installing remotes it gave me this:These packages have more recent versions available.It is recommended to update all of them.Which would you like to update?1: All                          2: CRAN packages only           3: None                         4: rlang (0.4.4 -> 0.4.5) [CRAN]5: cli   (1.1.0 -> 2.0.2) [CRAN]--> I selected 2.It was fine to use short GIF's to show how to do - but its a bit tricky to spot what the first step was (since the GIF just continues to run). Maybe a video-player where you can stop/play as you want would be better. (however not a big problem when the video is so short)
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I had to install the package 'remotes' prior to starting, which was fine, but it's not mentioned on the page (unless I missed it!). Might cause some confusion for some people who have never opened R prior to this:)"
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I have troubles installing Gitlab, It said: These packages have more recent versions available. It it took me three attemps to do it."

2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","In the beginning I had some problems to be able to solve the tasks, because I needed to download Rtools. This was not described in chapter 2, but after some time I managed to solve the problem using the instructions in R."
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It was in the beginning a bit unclear what exercises I should complete and what I should save, and what was done in the course itself (e.g., the group work assignment)."
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",It would be good if the material contains a section of possible errors/mistakes during the preparation
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","List of participants of the course (incl. institutions), maybe shared by email"
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe a phone number that you could call when all he problems comes up instead of an email adresse.
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",NA
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nil
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",No comments. It all worked well

2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",The GIFS were cool but sometimes I couldn't tell where the start point was
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",The code of conduct was very American style and maybe not that relevant in a Danish research setting
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","There were a lot of different links, opening a lot of internet tabs. Sometimes it was difficult to figure out where to find what. And for those of us with system administrated computers, we really have no control over the versions of R and Rstudio"
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",You can develop a video to explain the pre-course task
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","it is a problem to install/update certain softwares in the work computer and the helpdesk does not help in such short time. In the end, everything turned out to work, but it took much longer than I predicted to complete the pre-tasks. Since this course is to apply to our work, it would be good to consider and desgn the course to be done in the work computer."
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",maybe having more pre-course tasks!
2,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",maybe som audio on the small videos could replace some of the text or it could be in addition to the text.

2,"In your opinion, what worked well?","Good text descriptions and nice that the codes are included so it can be copy-pasted into R-studio. Good idea to let everyone see what and how to install necessary programs before the course, so we don't spend time on this in the actual course."
2,"In your opinion, what worked well?","I succeeded to install all programs, even though we have some problems with administrator rights in the RegionH. It is great to have the gifs with the screenshots. It is also very convenient to have the webpage with the entire program available beforehand. My colleage enquired about the administrative/ R version issues and that was immediately taken up on the webpage."

2,"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was very easy to understand what to do and follow the instructions in the pre-couse material. The small videos (eg. on to install packages) worked very well.
2,"In your opinion, what worked well?","Most of it - if you have right to install programs on your computer (I have but many of my collegues don't).

2,"In your opinion, what worked well?",The material for the pre-course is easy to follow
2,"In your opinion, what worked well?","The web-page is very well written.  However, I could not download the latest version of R. I have asked the administrators to make the latest version available but it takes several weeks to do so... I also had problems with the initial task because my computer did not have Rtools but that was solved. I hope the course will be possible even though it is not the latest version..."

3,Please describe the problems you've had.,"1) I didn't get the DONE after running the remotes installation. But I was able to do the rest of the preparation, so I think it worked at the end.2) I was asked if I wanted to install a compiliation when running remotes::install_gitlab(rostools/r3, upgrade = TRUE), I pressed yes, and it took forever and didn't look like the video. So I STOPped it and ran it again and this time pressed no, and then it looked fine."

5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I do not think this part of the course requires improvement. I did struggle with some installations (in R, of packages cli and purrrr), but as soon as I installed from binary instead of source it worked, I would have liked to see a warning that this could happen."
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I don't have any overall criticism because I think the tutorial was very good. More specifically I got an error when installing the r3 package:Error:                                                                           ! error in pak subprocessCaused by error: !

Actually, it will appear after creating a project, but this content is at the end of Section 4.3..."
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I had a problem with this commend:> r3::install_packages_introduction()✔ Updated metadata database: 5.07 MB in 12 files.                               ✔ Updating metadata database ... done                                           Error:                                                                           ! error in pak subprocessCaused by error: !

5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",In my particular case the following line of code throw me an error --->r3::install_packages_introduction().  This was the error:ℹ Building purrr 1.0.1Error:        ! error in pak subprocessCaused by error: ! Could not find tools necessary to compile a packageCall `pkgbuild::check_build_tools(debug = TRUE)` to diagnose the problem.ℹ See `$stderr` for standard error.
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",It worked great for me the way it is.
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It would be good to have more of a walkthrough for the installations and not just links to the websites. Especially during the Git installation there were a lot of different options that one had to go through, and more detailed instructions as to which options would be best for the course were missing. Also, I ran into problems when installing the R3 course package, but was very easily able to solve it (it was probably due to me having had it installed already), so maybe a list of possible errors and easy fixes might be helpful."
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It would be useful to have more screenshots of the steps when setting Git in RStudio. For example, I cannot find the Git tab in my RStudio and I thought that would create an error when installing the package remotes."

5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Some linkes were missing (e.g. the one to the cheat-sheet and the internal chapter reference at the end of 3.6:?sec-reproducible-documents.)
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The Pre-course tasks could be structured a bit more clearly. Now I started googling and installing the programs on my own, since the tasks started with install these programs and it was only later that I realised there were direct links to the sites I needed."
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The amount of reading required, in addition to the software installation, can be overwhelming. It is easy to get sidetracked during the installation process and lose focus on the task at hand. To alleviate this, I would appreciate a section with clear, step-by-step instructions on how to install all of the necessary software for the course. Once that is complete, the explanations and readings can be reviewed."
5,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",The use of a video instead of the text might be a timesaver.

6,Please describe the problems you've had.,I wasn't able to install pak package
6,Please describe the problems you've had.,"Installing homebrew, not intuitive to connect to Github."
6,Please describe the problems you've had.,"Installing this r3::install_packages_introduction(). It was solved by creating a new session.I have trouble following the instructions for setting up git with Rstudio. I installed it following the instructions, and Rstudios recognizes it as you can see from the setup code line earlier in the surveyThe following line leads to error (i can enter my name and email just fine)>  r3::setup_git_config()Error in libgit2::git_config_set_string :   failed to rename lockfile to 'U:\/.gitconfig': Adgang nægtet.I think it is because git has placed the file called .gitconfig in my personal AU-folder on the U: drive of aarhus university. I could imagine some sort of security in AU blocking the attempt to access it? I don't know what consequences this has for the function.If possible, i would like help with moving that file to a folder on the C: drive of my computer instead."

6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","For me, it would be okay to introduce basic commands for practice."
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","From my experience, troubleshooting in the package installation process could be helpful"
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I don't enjoy having to use your custom package to install packages (but I think I might not be the target). I also am curious why we are not creating an environment with renv::
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I got an error message that the r3 package did not exist. I use the newest R, and I could not solve this problem. This made it hard to figure out if I configured Git correct. Also, I have no Git tab in my R Studio - also unable to find out why"
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I had some issues with some command in the installation of r3 from rostools and had to use alternative commands to make it work. The pak::pkg_install command did not work, so I used: install_github(rostools/r3) instead, but were unable to update 12 of the packages"
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think all was good
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I think there could be a much more thorough explanation as to how to install Homebrew and Git - I've never used the terminal, and I suspect a lot of other people haven't either, so this really took me longer than it should have. Also if it hadn't been for ChatGPT I think I'd still be in the weeds."
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",It could be better if everything was in a sequence so there isnt links to follow and then go back and forth
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It is quite text heavy. Also, eventhough I followed the given instructions, my Rstudio could not perform the commands. Some setups on my laptop had to be altered, which chatGTP helped me with. Then it worked fine :-)"
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It was a bit confusing having to jump between diffent sections in the pre-course material. Maybe it would be preferable, if all the precourse material came in one gathered document or at one contineous webpage."
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Maybe I overlooked, but I never saw a statement about how to install R or make sure that you had the latest version. There was now sound on the videos, what that intended? If so, please state that the video does not include sound."
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Maybe highlight the sections that we need to read beforehand - yes it says it in the pre-course task, but you can quickly end up reading something you are not suppose to"
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe screenshots of the procedure of accessing  your Github account via r could be helpful for those who have no previous experience with R.
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",My experience so far has not been good because I encountered difficulties running some of the codes. It would be great if we could receive assistance before starting the course to ensure the successful installation of the libraries.
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",No comments
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",No current idea.
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing :)
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing as of now
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing comes to my mind. Great work.
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Nothing, it was a very nice introduction"
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Somehow I missed the requirement of pre-course responsibility and found about in the last email. Maybe the info about the prerequirements and deadline could be highlighted more.
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The code of conduct, although commendable, is a litte long winded and could perhaps be a little less verbose."
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The orientation on the website(s) was a bit confusing. Specifically when you were clicking links that went between these two main sites with very similar layout:https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org/preamble/pre-course.htmlandhttps://guides.rostools.org/pre-course.htmlI don't have a good way to fix this...Further, you might profit from adding the following:1. screenshots/video guide to the installation process of each program in Windows (I don't know about MacOS and Linux). I was asked during installation, what text editor i should use as the default, with some text explaining that i probably shouldn't choose the one already selected (vim). 2. A general remark along the lines of if the code provide in the introduction doesn't work in R studio , restart the session and try again3. As students/course attendants report issues, if possible add the most common issues and their solution in the instructionsThe link to Rtools for windows (https://guides.rostools.org/pre-course.html#installation-instructions) led me only to a website where i could get version 4.3, which doesn't work with the rest. It has been changed now it seems, so no worries."
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The survey should be open earlier, couldn't fill it out when doing pre-course tasks early on."
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",There is a lot of different links when you read through the sites and even new ones when you follow some of them. Maybe there could be some check-boxes or something for you to see if you have done what is expected and to keep track of where you are when you get back to the main pre-course site. Also everything in the sessions that we are not expected to have a look at before the course start can maybe be locked and then opened after the pre-course task deadline.Just some ideas :-)
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",i might tell you after the course - right now nothing props into my mind
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?",no cooments to make
6,"In your opinion, what could be improved?","the many links and some in a different webpage made it difficult to track where I was in the progress, and if I had done all the steps...There were no sound on the short videos.More short videos or screen dumps is very helpfull.The part about install Git was difficult in windows and difficult to understand where to write the different commands."
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?","A very nice, short and concise Pre-Course chapter. I loved the r3 package functions for installing all the needed packages in one go."
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything was explained clearly
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?",Great pre course intro - straight to the point
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?",Great with an webpage based syllabus and task environment.
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?",I had a lot of problems installing homebrew due to that my computer has MacOS Ventura and I needed to use another code to install homebrew in the terminal (that took quite a while to figure it out).
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?","I haven't made considerable progress yet, and I believe it's too soon to make any remarks."
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?",I liked the format of the html and how the sites were set up.
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?","I really enjoyed reading the code of conduct, I think all courses should include that."
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?",I think the R code for installing packages worked well.
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?","I think the structure worked quite well, and the interactiveness"

6,"In your opinion, what worked well?","Super easy to understand, and well written. Nice to be guided through the setup."
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?",The codes presented worked as they were supposed. It was nice with a video illustrating some of the things needed to be done in R.
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?","The detailed run though of  and setup was nice. I like the references with links to other sections in the pre-course section, so I could easily find the sections referred to without leaving the pre-course section."
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?","The guides for installing packages, finding Git etc. worked well / were easy to follow. The amount of pre-course preparations are doable."
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?",The introduction and the general
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?","The introduction was very well described. I learned some and is even more excited for the course. It is great that we are on the same page when starting the course, and to feel prepared for the course."
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?",The pre-course material was laid out in a well-organized and understable matter.
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?",The step by step instructions and the codes written up clear so there arent any doubts of when to do something
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?",The web-based introductory steps and short videos
6,"In your opinion, what worked well?","Very well written text material, not too complicated codes. It is nice to feel prepared going into a course, and these pre-course tasks helped me prioritize preparation in-between a lot of other working tasks."
