"In your opinion, what worked well?","A very nice, short and concise Pre-Course chapter. I loved the r3 package functions for installing all the needed packages in one go."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything was explained clearly
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Great pre course intro - straight to the point
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Great with an webpage based syllabus and task environment.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I had a lot of problems installing homebrew due to that my computer has MacOS Ventura and I needed to use another code to install homebrew in the terminal (that took quite a while to figure it out).
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I haven't made considerable progress yet, and I believe it's too soon to make any remarks."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I liked the format of the html and how the sites were set up.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I really enjoyed reading the code of conduct, I think all courses should include that."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I think the R code for installing packages worked well.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I think the structure worked quite well, and the interactiveness"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It is nice to get a general introduction and make sure we all have installed the programs in order to not waste time.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It is structured and consise. Easy to follow up.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was interactive in the way of guiding me through how to setup R.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was very easy to follow and gave access to further knowledge if interested.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Super easy to understand, and well written. Nice to be guided through the setup."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The codes presented worked as they were supposed. It was nice with a video illustrating some of the things needed to be done in R.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The detailed run though of "" and setup was nice. I like the references with links to other sections in the pre-course section, so I could easily find the sections referred to without leaving the pre-course section."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The guides for installing packages, finding Git etc. worked well / were easy to follow. The amount of pre-course preparations are doable."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The introduction and the general
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The introduction was very well described. I learned some and is even more excited for the course. It is great that we are on the same page when starting the course, and to feel prepared for the course."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The pre-course material was laid out in a well-organized and understable matter.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The step by step instructions and the codes written up clear so there arent any doubts of when to do something
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The web-based introductory steps and short videos
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Very well written text material, not too complicated codes. It is nice to feel prepared going into a course, and these pre-course tasks helped me prioritize preparation in-between a lot of other working tasks."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Well written and structured material.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Well written material that is easy to understand and easy to navigate online
"In your opinion, what worked well?",all fine
"In your opinion, what worked well?",the instructions for instaling git etc are super clear
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","For me, it would be okay to introduce basic commands for practice."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","From my experience, troubleshooting in the package installation process could be helpful"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I don't enjoy having to use your custom package to install packages (but I think I might not be the target). I also am curious why we are not creating an environment with renv::
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I got an error message that the r3 package did not exist. I use the newest R, and I could not solve this problem. This made it hard to figure out if I configured Git correct. Also, I have no ""Git"" tab in my R Studio - also unable to find out why"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I had some issues with some command in the installation of r3 from rostools and had to use alternative commands to make it work. The pak::pkg_install command did not work, so I used: install_github(""rostools/r3"") instead, but were unable to update 12 of the packages"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think all was good
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I think there could be a much more thorough explanation as to how to install Homebrew and Git - I've never used the terminal, and I suspect a lot of other people haven't either, so this really took me longer than it should have. Also if it hadn't been for ChatGPT I think I'd still be in the weeds."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",It could be better if everything was in a sequence so there isnt links to follow and then go back and forth
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It is quite text heavy. Also, eventhough I followed the given instructions, my Rstudio could not perform the commands. Some setups on my laptop had to be altered, which chatGTP helped me with. Then it worked fine :-)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It was a bit confusing having to jump between diffent sections in the pre-course material. Maybe it would be preferable, if all the precourse material came in one gathered document or at one contineous webpage."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Maybe I overlooked, but I never saw a statement about how to install R or make sure that you had the latest version. There was now sound on the videos, what that intended? If so, please state that the video does not include sound."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Maybe highlight the sections that we need to read beforehand - yes it says it in the pre-course task, but you can quickly end up reading something you are not suppose to"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe screenshots of the procedure of accessing  your Github account via r could be helpful for those who have no previous experience with R.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",My experience so far has not been good because I encountered difficulties running some of the codes. It would be great if we could receive assistance before starting the course to ensure the successful installation of the libraries.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",No comments
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",No current idea.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing :)

"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing comes to my mind. Great work.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Nothing, it was a very nice introduction"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Somehow I missed the requirement of pre-course responsibility and found about in the last email. Maybe the info about the prerequirements and deadline could be highlighted more.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The code of conduct, although commendable, is a litte long winded and could perhaps be a little less verbose."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The orientation on the website(s) was a bit confusing. Specifically when you were clicking links that went between these two main sites with very similar layout:https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org/preamble/pre-course.htmlandhttps://guides.rostools.org/pre-course.htmlI don't have a good way to fix this...Further, you might profit from adding the following:1. screenshots/video guide to the installation process of each program in Windows (I don't know about MacOS and Linux). I was asked during installation, what text editor i should use as the default, with some text explaining that i probably shouldn't choose the one already selected (vim). 2. A general remark along the lines of ""if the code provide in the introduction doesn't work in R studio , restart the session and try again""3. As students/course attendants report issues, if possible add the most common issues and their solution in the instructionsThe link to Rtools for windows (https://guides.rostools.org/pre-course.html#installation-instructions) led me only to a website where i could get version 4.3, which doesn't work with the rest. It has been changed now it seems, so no worries."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The survey should be open earlier, couldn't fill it out when doing pre-course tasks early on."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",There is a lot of different links when you read through the sites and even new ones when you follow some of them. Maybe there could be some check-boxes or something for you to see if you have done what is expected and to keep track of where you are when you get back to the main pre-course site. Also everything in the sessions that we are not expected to have a look at before the course start can maybe be locked and then opened after the pre-course task deadline.Just some ideas :-)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",i might tell you after the course - right now nothing props into my mind
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",no cooments to make
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","the many links and some in a different webpage made it difficult to track where I was in the progress, and if I had done all the steps...There were no sound on the short videos.More short videos or screen dumps is very helpfull.The part about install Git was difficult in windows and difficult to understand where to write the different commands."

It was solved by creating a new session.I have trouble following the instructions for setting up git with Rstudio. I installed it following the instructions, and Rstudios recognizes it as you can see from the ""setup"" code line earlier in the surveyThe following line leads to error (i can enter my name and email just fine)>  r3::setup_git_config()Error in libgit2::git_config_set_string :   failed to rename lockfile to 'U:\/.gitconfig': Adgang nægtet.I think it is because git has placed the file called "".gitconfig"" in my personal AU-folder on the U: drive of aarhus university.
