2023-04-27,10/10 course and would recommend it to all my R-illiterate friends.Perhaps consider a different location.The food was really great. The classroom was not suited for this kind of lecture where we are so dependent to see the projector. Internet issues.
2023-04-27,Thanks for a great course :)
2023-04-27,"Keep going! Hope to return for the intermediate course, it was fun and very valuable to learn so much"
2023-04-27,Really well prepared course and super helpful instructors!
2023-04-27,Thank you for introducing me to the new world of R and data reproducibility :-)
2023-04-27,Very good course! 10/10 would recommend
2023-04-27,"I would love to be a helper/instructor!!! contact: Pete@sdu.dk if you need anyone, Luke :D"
2023-04-27,the course is very inspiring. Go git!
2023-04-27,thanks for this time - no additional comments
2023-04-27,Great course. I really enjoyed it. It is nice to feel that the instructors are enthusiastic about the subject.
2023-04-27,"Most sessions were short on time and we had to skip things. This left very little room for ""reflections"" on the content, that we had just learned, or even the option to play with the new code we were just taught."
2023-04-27,"The reading tasks could easily be partly structured as home tasks instead, so that the time can be used discussing and practical learning the difficult stuff at classes"
2023-04-27,"I am so grateful for this opportunity. Sending love to Luke, the instructors,  theattendees, and DDEA"
2023-04-27,"This course is the best course i have attended as a phd. Interactive, changing learning methodes including read along worked very well :)"
2023-04-27,It was a great course!!
2023-04-27,"I just want to say thank you, this has by far been the best course I've attended during my PhD so far, both in terms of the things that I've learned and also structure of the course. I feel it's really given me the tools to continue on my own, and I very much look forwards to the intermediate course!"
2023-04-27,I would like the possiblity to join a course which only focuses or primarily focuses in coding in R and not as much on working with git.
2023-04-27,"I must really say that this was a great course (so far, one of the best PhD course that I have taken so far). :)"
2023-04-27,"It was a great experience, had a great time and learned a lot! Thannk you all for the efforts!"
2023-04-27,"I feel like a session on merging data sets and tidying up messy data sets would be awesome. I guess its coming in the intermediate part.maybe just a quick "" this is how you merge, often you need much cleaning afterwards"" or"
2023-04-27,"We were sitting still a lot for a long time:- the venues tables and chairs wasn't the best- there could have been small 3-minute breaks, where all should stand-up, stretch and do a few exercises for the neck and shoulders.The free-time in the afternoon was good, because you get really filled-up with infomation.Very convenient with hotel, venue and restaurant so close to each other."
