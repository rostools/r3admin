Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"For almost all sessions today, we were short on time and had to skip things. This left very little room for ""reflections"" on the content, that we had just learned, or even the option to play with the new code we were just taught.",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Despite the niceness of already set groups, it would have been great to team up with people who you got along well with or who you somehow levelled with in coding.",NA
Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,It was great that the groups were already set so we didn't have to find people ourselves.,NA

Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,write along is always good :),NA
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"The assignment was good, no specific improvement ideers",NA
Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,nice way to test - not only R skills but also Git :),NA
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,To se the plots and all the cool things you can get out of using R. The write along was good and the tempo was really good.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Nothing. It was really good.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Nothing. It was very well balanced in how difficult it was.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,"To use the skills we have been practicing was really good. Being in small groups all doing something on their own, but helping each others (and having a teacher helping as well) was really good.",NA
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,I think the content was super great and very didactic.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"I think it was a little rushed, but I also know that's because we were delayed from the other days. We also didn't get to finish all the objectives, but that's really okay cause I know the website is super easy to follow by yourself as well.",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"I don't think anything could be improved, it was really good.",NA
Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,"I think that worked super well overall, it was really nice we had an instructor assigned to each group so we could get help with everything we needed. It was also super satisfactory to test the reproducibility together at the end.",NA

Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,I learned so much from this and it was a lot of fun putting the data into plots.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"It would have been great if we could have had a little bit more time for the exercises, or even more exercises to really practice all the commands.",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Maybe have more available datasets that we can pick, so that the chance of everyone picking the same one is less likely.",NA
Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,"It was fun to put everything together that we had learned and make it reproducible. At that it became really great to see the reproducibility in practice. It was also helpful to have a dedicated supervisor, who helped us along if we got stuck.",NA
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Interesting and good to have codes for further use,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"Just few smaller this. It went a bit fast, often, if one could not follow or had problems the code was not visible anymore. Also the curser text was sometimes in front of the code text above",NA
Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,good to work together and have a bit individual work too,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,"Covering the most used type of graphs and leaving out the more ""shiny"" details helped getting the main idea without feeling so overwhelmed.",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,no comments,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,no comments,NA
Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,instructions were clear and all the knowledge we needed was covered in class,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,It was nice to see how fairly easy it is to create very different graphs,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"Slow down just abit, and remember to scroll up to the code once it's ran and created an image.",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Quite a bit of time went into defining what we should do inside the group. If you narrow down the objectives more, e.g. student 1 make a table, student 2 makes a figure of x and y etc. More time would be spent actually trying to figure out stuff",NA
Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,Collaborating on doing it correctly.,NA
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,"The live coding sessions made it very clear how easy visualization is, and that we were doing the same codes several times to get them in the fingers.It was clear that visualization can be used both to look into the data and also to present data.",NA
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,A cheatsheet with the most common codes to make figures and tables visually beautifull and tidy.,NA
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,A little more time could be usefull,NA
Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,Very fun and instructive to work together on an asignment. Also very similar to what we are going to do with our own projects.,NA
