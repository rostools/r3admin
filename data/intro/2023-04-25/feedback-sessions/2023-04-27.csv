Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,A cheatsheet with the most common codes to make figures and tables visually beautifull and tidy.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"Even more themes, labels and stuff"
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"For almost all sessions today, we were short on time and had to skip things. This left very little room for ""reflections"" on the content, that we had just learned, or even the option to play with the new code we were just taught."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"Honestly.. Nothing, only more time!"
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"I think it was a little rushed, but I also know that's because we were delayed from the other days. We also didn't get to finish all the objectives, but that's really okay cause I know the website is super easy to follow by yourself as well."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,It was really nice
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"It would have been great if we could have had a little bit more time for the exercises, or even more exercises to really practice all the commands."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"Just few smaller this. It went a bit fast, often, if one could not follow or had problems the code was not visible anymore. Also the curser text was sometimes in front of the code text above"
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"More information about customizing charts, labels positions etc."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,More time for individual assignments performing data visualization
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,No suggestions

Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,maybe links or tools to where to go and learn more about it.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,more time
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,no comments
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,nothing:)
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"the wrongly ordered factors were an eyesore, and I think it would be a nice addon to address how they can be rearranged"
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,A little more time could be usefull
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Despite the niceness of already set groups, it would have been great to team up with people who you got along well with or who you somehow levelled with in coding."
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"I don't think anything could be improved, it was really good."
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"I would prefer if the group work, was instead of making a group report, would be working on separate reports and helping each other out with the assignments."
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,It was a bit stressfull and cramped with the time.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,It was a little tight with time - it was OK though :)
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Maybe groups of 2 would be better
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Maybe have more available datasets that we can pick, so that the chance of everyone picking the same one is less likely."
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Maybe in pairs next time
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Maybe more troubleshoot codes on the webpage
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,More time perhaps.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Nothing.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,Nothing. It was very well balanced in how difficult it was.
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"Quite a bit of time went into defining what we should do inside the group. If you narrow down the objectives more, e.g. student 1 make a table, student 2 makes a figure of x and y etc. More time would be spent actually trying to figure out stuff"
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"The assignment was good, no specific improvement ideers"
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,The time was a bit too short for the complete assignment
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,"The timeline is a bit short. Perhaps a more detailed assignment. I think we spent too much time on ""Tidying"" up the dataset."
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,assign more time for a project assignment
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,even more time would be nice
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,nil
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,no comments
Day 3,could be improved for the group project assignment,nothing
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,"Covering the most used type of graphs and leaving out the more ""shiny"" details helped getting the main idea without feeling so overwhelmed."
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Everything! Think it was super great
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,"Great introduction to different plots and graph, and a very nice explanation of the ""layering technique"" og ggplot."
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,I learned so much from this and it was a lot of fun putting the data into plots.
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,I think the content was super great and very didactic.
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Interesting and good to have codes for further use
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Is was nice getting to visualise some date
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,It was all great. Great explanations and good speed.
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,It was great to try out different graphs and get a sense of what was possible. The tempo was nice
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,It was nice to see how fairly easy it is to create very different graphs
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,NIce layered approach.
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,"Really nice walkthrough if ggplot, and nice with the markdown integration."
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,The code alongs were great!
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,"The live coding sessions made it very clear how easy visualization is, and that we were doing the same codes several times to get them in the fingers.It was clear that visualization can be used both to look into the data and also to present data."
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,The many code-alongs training similar things. Worked well to get used to the codes
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,The pace of the lecture. The hands on part doing the exercises.
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,The visualizations were pretty and the code easy to use
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,"Thorough introduction - a bit fast because we were short on time, but it was manageable"
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,To se the plots and all the cool things you can get out of using R. The write along was good and the tempo was really good.

Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,"I think that worked super well overall, it was really nice we had an instructor assigned to each group so we could get help with everything we needed. It was also super satisfactory to test the reproducibility together at the end."
Day 3,worked well for the group project assignment,"It was fun to put everything together that we had learned and make it reproducible. At that it became really great to see the reproducibility in practice. It was also helpful to have a dedicated supervisor, who helped us along if we got stuck."
