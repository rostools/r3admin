Day 2,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,I think the advanced exercise could be better described. More specific what and why we are doing?
Day 2,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,Don't have anything on the top of my head
Day 2,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,"Everything, started simple and then go more complicated. I feel very suited for using Markdown."
Day 2,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,"Good introduction of all the basics stuff, and good expertise in the more advance pipelines"
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"Get to know how choose specific colors, fond and the design of figure"
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,I do not have any feedback.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"I think we need more resources for how to customize graphs. Maybe an ""optional"" thing with a few key ways to modify graphs? Because otherwise I feel it is hard to convince people to move from something like Prism."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,It was just perfect. The pace and details were appropiate
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Learning how to changed name of columns e.g. diabetes yes no
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Maybe do a little less repitition - many of the graphs in the code along was very similar.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"More a general thing; it could also be practical if some of the scripts did not work, and one would have to figure out why/how to fix it."
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Nothing
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Nothing comes to mind.
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Nothing specific
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"Perhaps a few practical examples of why it's better to use ggplot instead of base R plotting? And in general,  a short explanation of how and when different packages work together and when they don't?"
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,Worked well
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,all good
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,can't come up with anything
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,can't think of anything
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,"it sometimes went a little fast and then the screen moved to the image, so we couldnt see the code"
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,nothing
Day 3,could be improved for the Data visualization,x
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Again I really like the code-along sections. It works very well.
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,"As for the previous sessions and days, the code-along format works very well!"
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Code along and exercises
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Code-along
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Covered a lot of graphs and how and when to make them. I like how it was organized
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Data visualization with coding along was great!!!
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Everything
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Good to see all the examples of different data visualization in R. Coding along is good.
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Hands-on was great! All of it was nice
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Individual assignments
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Instructions were very clear and it was really nice to make the figures
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,It provides with a great overall skill in data visualization.
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,"Nice to try a lot of different plots, grams etc. with both discrete and continuous variables. Code-along sessions worked very well"
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,Showing how to utilize the %>% together with geom_ . Working directly in the R markdown was also great
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,"Super cool. It was nice to see the feature, and the possibilities."
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,That we were through so many different figure styles
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,The code along was super nice. Very excited to implement ggplot2 in my work.
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,"The instructor was good at saying what she typed, i.e. ""this is the package, this is the function in the package"" etc."
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,There was time to look into the figures.
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,code-along
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,everything
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,learned lots about plottings
Day 3,worked well for the Data visualization,very pretty graphs
