"In your opinion, what worked well?","At man får lov til at snuse til kodespriget, grundigt vejledt af GIF´s"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything looked god and I am looking forward
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything worked well.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Good text descriptions and nice that the codes are included so it can be copy-pasted into R-studio. Good idea to let everyone see what and how to install necessary programs before the course, so we don't spend time on this in the actual course."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I succeeded to install all programs, even though we have some problems with administrator rights in the RegionH. It is great to have the gifs with the screenshots. It is also very convenient to have the webpage with the entire program available beforehand. My colleage enquired about the administrative/ R version issues and that was immediately taken up on the webpage."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I think it was very easy to follow the instructions when downloading the R packages
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I think the tasks are clearly described and easy to follow
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Interactive GIF images that describe required tasks
"In your opinion, what worked well?","It was a nice guidance with combined gifs, texts, and practical assignments."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was a very easy-to-follow manual. And I had no trouble downloading GIT although working on a windows computer
"In your opinion, what worked well?",It was very easy to understand what to do and follow the instructions in the pre-couse material. The small videos (eg. on to install packages) worked very well.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Most of it - if you have right to install programs on your computer (I have but many of my collegues don't). I have R and Rstudio from our softwareshop at my working place, and the newest versions are not the newest available, but I will keep those i have from our softwareshop."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","No problems, but took some time to understand and implement"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Overall chapter 2 is very pedagogical and it is easy to overlook the text.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The GIFs were a great way to ensure I was on the right track.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The GIFs worked very well. Easy overview.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The course seems well thought out. It definitely helps to know the softwares (especially the versions) required for the course and ensuring that they are preinstalled before we start the course.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The gifs / movies that show how to install certain things.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The installation explanation with codes that you could copy to clipboard.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The instruction is very clear and easy understanding, it is also user friendly with examples and gif."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The instructions are clear
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The instructions of the exercises were clear, and the videos clarified the details"
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The instructions were all clear and I particularly liked the gifs for added help. All the links in the instructions were also very helpful, making the process smooth."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The material for the pre-course is easy to follow
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The web-page is very well written.  However, I could not download the latest version of R. I have asked the administrators to make the latest version available but it takes several weeks to do so... I also had problems with the initial task because my computer did not have Rtools but that was solved. I hope the course will be possible even though it is not the latest version..."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Very detailed and thorough walk through of the installations and course outline
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Very pedagogical language, easy to understand"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",embedded links step-by-step instructions

"In your opinion, what worked well?",very clear and straightforward
"In your opinion, what worked well?","yes, it work well but have a little trouble with Git"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",...
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Code of conduct could be shorter. I understand it is necessary, but very wordy :)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Guidelines for installation of Git. I hade to go through a lot of steps. I just choose the defualt setting - and hope this is right. A note on whtether this is what should be done could be nice. And is something else should be done, this should be described."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Hvis linket havde virket hele tiden
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I am satisfied
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I cannot think of anything, everything was very clear and well structured."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I didn't get the exact same output in R-studio as in the GIF videos - but it seemed to work anyway. When installing remotes it gave me this:""These packages have more recent versions available.It is recommended to update all of them.Which would you like to update?1: All                          2: CRAN packages only           3: None                         4: rlang (0.4.4 -> 0.4.5) [CRAN]5: cli   (1.1.0 -> 2.0.2) [CRAN]""--> I selected 2.It was fine to use short GIF's to show how to do - but its a bit tricky to spot what the first step was (since the GIF just continues to run). Maybe a video-player where you can stop/play as you want would be better. (however not a big problem when the video is so short)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I had to install the package 'remotes' prior to starting, which was fine, but it's not mentioned on the page (unless I missed it!). Might cause some confusion for some people who have never opened R prior to this:)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I have troubles installing Gitlab, It said: These packages have more recent versions available. It it took me three attemps to do it."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I think although having problems with Git, all the instructions are straight forward"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think it was quite straight and easy to follow.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think it's good as it is.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I thought the pre-course material was more time demanding. Maybe I have missed something.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I was unsure whether earlier versions of R could be used (the newest was not available to me as an Region H employed). But got an email answer on that, so all good."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","In the beginning I had some problems to be able to solve the tasks, because I needed to download Rtools. This was not described in chapter 2, but after some time I managed to solve the problem using the instructions in R."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It was in the beginning a bit unclear what exercises I should complete and what I should save, and what was done in the course itself (e.g., the group work assignment)."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","It would be good if the material contains a section of ""possible errors/mistakes"" during the preparation"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","List of participants of the course (incl. institutions), maybe shared by email"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe a phone number that you could call when all he problems comes up instead of an email adresse.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",NA
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nil
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",No comments. It all worked well
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing that I can think of at this stage.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Remainders of pre-course tasks
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",The GIFS were cool but sometimes I couldn't tell where the start point was
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The code of conduct was very ""American"" style and maybe not that relevant in a Danish research setting"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","There were a lot of different links, opening a lot of internet tabs. Sometimes it was difficult to figure out where to find what. And for those of us with system administrated computers, we really have no control over the versions of R and Rstudio"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",You can develop a video to explain the pre-course task
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","it is a problem to install/update certain softwares in the work computer and the helpdesk does not help in such short time. In the end, everything turned out to work, but it took much longer than I predicted to complete the pre-tasks. Since this course is to apply to our work, it would be good to consider and desgn the course to be done in the work computer."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",maybe having more pre-course tasks!
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",maybe som audio on the small videos could replace some of the text or it could be in addition to the text.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",no suggestion so far
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",none
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",nothing:-)

Please describe the problems you've had.,"I was installing GIT on my lap top, and I had to take different decisions about the required installation files, which I did not know about. A colleague helped me, but I am still not sure if have taken the right decisions. Hope that I will encounter no problems during the course."
Please describe the problems you've had.,It took me three times to install Gitlab. It said: These packages have more recent versions available. And at the end of the process it gave me errors
Please describe the problems you've had.,Please have a look at my previously answer
Please describe the problems you've had.,"we don't have administrator rights on the work computers in RegionH, so all programs need to be installed via the software/ computer center of the Region. they add requested programs to the "" softwareshop"" upon request, but that takes quite some time since they need to be checked for saftety. It is meant to help protect patient data but can make installing programs very slow."
