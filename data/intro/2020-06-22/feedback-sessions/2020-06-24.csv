Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,Could have come in earlier - think it will save some work if we could start the report earlier.
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"Create the joint manuscript earlier, and lean GIt a little earlier, so that we could push our fidings every time we learned something new, instead of creating the manuscript at the end.I would have liked to learn more about how to download, load, read the dataset we find (in different formats, so we are prepared for future datasets)"
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"I think time was very well use but I would add maybe 30 min more for group work, in the end where the knowledge seems more applicable, specially after R Markdown"
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"I would have preferred less time on things like bold/italics etc. (as I could read these in a separate resource file) and would have preferred to spend more time on how to setup the file (i.e., how much to link in source code/datasets/script/package loading)."
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,I would like to have more time to play a bit more with the data and final report  but it is not so important.
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,If  we had been prepared for the challenges with our project in the Markdown folder
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"If time allows, we could work on a short manuscript, to demonstrate how it works and show its advantage compared to the traditional way."
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,Maybe this could have been done at the beginning so we could start the project in that set up.
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,More time for figure stuff out  could be very benefical
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,More time on exercise section might be helpful.
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,More time to work with the group assessments
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,Nothing to declare
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,Pre-Course reading materials
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,We could have used a bit more time for the group work
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,a little more time for the exercise would be good
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,good
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"it ended up being a bit too fast and therefore we did not learn all the possible adds to the R markdown. It could also have been fun to see examples of how other people are using the R markdown, besides the course website."
Day 3,could be improved for the Creating reproducible documents,"may be, you could get input from participants on how to walk the talk."
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,All the steps and materials to follow where written clearly
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,Great lecture. Nice to learn about how to use R-markdown.
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,Great to play with the figures and clean data
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,"I liked the session in general. Is a lot of knowledge to digest but the way that it was kept simple, helped to go through it."
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,I liked to discover there is the Markdown file that helps having the process and outcomes organized.
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,I really liked the idea of R Markdown (like a lot of others).
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,"It was easy to understand why the R.markdown is a smart feature. It was also in this session that it really made sense to me why the GitHub is cool. The exercise part was really important to learn how to do this on our own, and it made more sense to me in practice, compared to when we went through it in the lecture."
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,"It was very nice to learn how to collaborate over Git by hands-on sessions, struggling was the best way to get it better. And at the end, having a final document with structure was so motivating and encouraging."
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,It was well organized and well explained.
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,It worked well on project based level.
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,"It worked well with the code along. The time for it was sufficient. Nice to have specific code for headings, bold text etc."
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,"Nice to learn Rmarkdown, code-along and group work with different tasks and combining them results in a joint manuscript"
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,"The creation of the Markdown file, which gives the full view in one file/document"
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,"The exercises on our own and in the group, The help from the teachers."
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,"The initial lecture, short but setting the case why reproducible research is necessary. good examples of innovative research documents. Learning by doing the R markdown files, all the exercise parts."
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,Very nice section - easy
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,almost everything
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,good
Day 3,worked well for the Creating reproducible documents,lecture was pretty nice
