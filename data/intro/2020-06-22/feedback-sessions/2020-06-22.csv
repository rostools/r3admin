Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"Exercise 6.5 was given a short time  and instruction were not straightforward. Please, make sure that participants know how to interact with R (e.g., write and execute codes, familiar with the interface, etc).the lecture on open source data should be more interactive.Please, adjust the light.

Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,More explanation maybe,NA
Day 1,worked well for the Management of R projects,"I really liked the course structure. It is a great mix of lectures and hands-on exercises. And you came up with a great system for people to signal that they need help or are done with their tasks. I am a beginner, i.e. have done very little programming before, and I think that there is plenty of time to do the tasks, which is really nice. It is a great intro to R. Thank you so much.",NA
