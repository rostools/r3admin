Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,I think it worked well just some things more difficult to processes but good
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"It would have been helpful to have more exercises where we could try and build the code ourselves (i.e., to apply some of the new functions). At times, I felt like I was just copying/typing what the teacher was typing."
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"Maybe have some data-sets ready that we can use, so we don't use too much time on finding them ourselves."
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,Maybe more time to understand the coding
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,More breaks and providing more explanation for the exercises
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,Nothing I can think of
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,Nothing specific
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,"Nothing, the pace was good"
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,Perhaps a bit more explanation of the different functions - I kind of lost track in the pivoting and grouping part. It would have been nice to start with this session in the morning with a fresh brain :-)
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,Some more exercises with different combinations of functions could be useful.
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,The last session would be easier to follow-up.
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,There could be more exercises we should do on our own.
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,explain the purpose of the function - examples of when you would use them
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,more explanation about the code
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,more hands on coding
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,see above session
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,sometimes I felt some of the functions could have had an introduction on what they will do
Day 1,could be improved for the Data management and wrangling,was very good
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,A bit more explanation/definition of each task before we begin the task
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,Don't know
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"Exercise 6.5 was given a short time  and instruction were not straightforward. Please, make sure that participants know how to interact with R (e.g., write and execute codes, familiar with the interface, etc).the lecture on open source data should be more interactive.Please, adjust the light. I struggled to view the slides and follow the instructions on the screen."
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"I cannot come up with anything right now. Again, I really liked the course structure."
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,I think the first day was good
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"If time allowed, more statistical coding will be helpful."
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,It felt like it was really slow to move at times.
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,It was nice
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,Maybe the management of projects could be moved to later in the course. It was difficult to follow with no previous experience with R projects.
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,More explanation maybe
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,Nothing specific
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,Nothing that I can think of right now.
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,Providing basic concepts (e.g.: terminologies on R) before hands-on
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,The last session was a bit intense and get lost because of the tiredness of the all day.
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,good
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"more hands on coding, maybe start the group excercise for the begining"
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"nothing,"
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,All the instructions and coding together.
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,Code along. Great with the website with all the coding
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,Coding on our own computers
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,Eevrything
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,"Good examples, and good that it was not an ""expert"" teaching this."
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,Good with hands on exercises
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,Hands-on exercises
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,"I have ever used tidyverse before, so it was interesting to learn it."
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,It was helpful to see the teacher correct/debug her own code as she went.
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,"Simple, code-along, blue/orange post-its"
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,The code along
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,The code along worked well.
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,The examples are very helpful.
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,The timming in teaching

Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,good
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,see above session
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,straight fordward
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,"the code-along, makes it easier to understand what we are doing"
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,"trying out the different functions in the ""code-along"" style"
Day 1,worked well for the Data management and wrangling,was very good
Day 1,worked well for the Management of R projects,All sessions were well organised and easy to follow
Day 1,worked well for the Management of R projects,All the code along part
Day 1,worked well for the Management of R projects,Coding on our own computers

Day 1,worked well for the Management of R projects,Good with hands on exercises
Day 1,worked well for the Management of R projects,Hands-on exercises
Day 1,worked well for the Management of R projects,I really liked hearing about how good practice of R Projects related to reproducibility.
Day 1,worked well for the Management of R projects,"I really liked the course structure. It is a great mix of lectures and hands-on exercises. And you came up with a great system for people to signal that they need help or are done with their tasks. I am a beginner, i.e. have done very little programming before, and I think that there is plenty of time to do the tasks, which is really nice. It is a great intro to R. Thank you so much."
