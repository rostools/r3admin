date,response
2021-06-17,i forgot the data loading from the first day by the time that we needed it for the assignment. would be good to have a recap in the mornings
2021-06-17,"Group assignment was stressfull  with ragrsds to time, noise and romm temperature"
2021-06-17,Say that we should work in separate RMarkdown files for the group assignment
2021-06-17,"All instructors were really great and seemed very committed to teaching us how to use R and encoruinging us to be open and honest about the science that we will do in the future. Please send me the dates for a now intermediate course when you have planned it, I would very much like to attend"
2021-06-17,"I thought it was a really great intro. I think when you sign up you should be already encouraged to do two courses because three days is simply not enough to get through enough material to be able to go back and do this on your own, confidently."
2021-06-17,Keep on doing a good job. I would love to have more statistic in the course. Just do a simple t.test but we do not have that much time
2021-06-17,"Super useful course, great instructors. Some days were a little long, but I think it finished off great with the challenge, and it was great to try to implement what we have learned as a group. Perhaps there could be a few breaks from sitting in front of a screen somehow (maybe an energizer? or a little walk around a building talking about some concepts?) just to freshen things up. Otherwise great and I will highly recommend it to anyone :)"
2021-06-17,It was a great course and I would highly recommend it to my beginner colleagues. I have had a great time.
2021-06-17,"Great course! As already mentioned to some instructors, a bit more of a basic introduction (could be provided in pre-course material) would be great. e.g. what is a script/code/package etc."
2021-06-17,"Perhaps more introduction to R in pre course material for those, who haven't worked with R or other coding programs before. Perhaps some introduction videos, that would have to be watched before the start of the course."
2021-06-17,"A bit more step-by-step guidance for the group work. It was a good task - but I liked, that It didn't last for longer than the last day."
2021-06-17,"It has really been a great course and I like how everything is summed up in the final exercise. With regard to the exercise, we could have benefited from a short joint introduction. Furthermore, the initial part of the exercise involved one person working on a computer without the rest of the group being able to see the screen. If possible, could each group get a separate meeting room where we can share the screen of the person typing. Or could we use a zoom meeting, where the screen can be saved? Other than that, everything was good."
2021-06-17,"Maybe a bigger projector screen would be nice? Even though everything is written in the course material, sometimes the code written by the instructor can be a little bit different. Or if new code is typed in (e.g. following a question) it can be really hard to see it. Maybe a bit more comprehensive introduction of the git interface would be nice."
2021-06-17,I think it has been a great course!
2021-06-17,"About the team exercise on day 3 - the idea is great and very useful, but I really think that a short introduction to what is expected and how to start working together would have been needed to get the maximal benefit of the exercise. Eg. pointing out that it is not smart to work in the same document all at once to avoid having merge problems all the time would have been nice. But all in all, a useful exercise :)"
