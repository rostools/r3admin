Please describe the problems you've had.,"1) I didn't get the ""DONE"" after running the remotes installation. But I was able to do the rest of the preparation, so I think it worked at the end.2) I was asked if I wanted to install a compiliation when running remotes::install_gitlab(""rostools/r3"", upgrade = TRUE), I pressed yes, and it took forever and didn't look like the video. So I STOPped it and ran it again and this time pressed no, and then it looked fine."
Please describe the problems you've had.,I had some problems installing r3 but then realised that it was because I haven't installed Git yet.
Please describe the problems you've had.,Instaling the newest version of R-studio on my work laptop - (RegionH)
