Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,I don't have any complains
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"I will prefer to add a section about ""how to upload your data"" e.g.  have an example with data in an excel file instead of ""air quality""."
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"If that was explained with an example of previous data (data frame), I think it would be very nice."
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"If you insist on introducing vectors, naming and syntax at this point, maybe you could tell a little more about what it is used for"
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,It could be even more applied if we used a fictive research project and build it up in R

Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"Some of the areas was not completely clear, eg. what to use them for (eg the here function)"
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"Sometimes it went too fast. and at some point the helpers were talking too loud, so it was difficult to hear the presenter. It was very distracting. I suggest that either the helpers whisper while the presenter continues the session, or the presenter waits for everyone to be ready before continuing."
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"Sometimes it's hard to understand exactly what you are doing, but I think it's also difficult to explain in an easy way sometimes."

Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,It could also be more applied if we used a fictive case
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"It is not necessary to include ""what do we think is difficult in our collaboration now""."
