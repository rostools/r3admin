Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,Again more homework to do after the course with answers would be good
Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,Everything worked fine
Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,"For me specifically, it would also great to have a session on data modelling and curve fitting (i.e. dose-response), but I don't know for how many people that would actually be relevant, so I understand if that is too specific."
Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,"I don't think we needed to spend hours and hours on plots with colour schemes; I would have preferred to use this time to understand some of the ways to use R in practice (e.g., I'm still unclear on what here::here even means)."
Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,"I think the session was so clear, nicely paced."
Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,I would have liked some more introduction on how to best search for help online. Like a troubleshooting session on how to fix issues on your own.
Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,"I would have liked to know a bit more about the different functions, what exactly they do, sometimes their names sound a bit strange"
Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,I would like to learn how to add SE/SEM bars etc. but this is a minor suggestion. I think the session was incredibly informative and beneficial
Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,"If there are more practice, it will be helpful."
Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,Maybe too much coding in a row without exercise
Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,More coding

Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,all good
Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,even thought it is much the same
Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,maybe a vew too many examples that used the same/very similar code
Day 2,could be improved for the Data visualization,"to many example that looked likes each other. Would prefer to learn more options instead, for instance category1=color1, category2=color2 instead of several data schemes"
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"Add more illustrations, videos, cartoons, ...... so we can follow the instructions."
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"I don't think we needed as much time as we did spent on ""what collaboration is"" (as lots of us are already in collaborations). I'd rather have spent more time getting clear on what push/pull means in practice, and I feel that we rushed through things like branching/merging. I'm not sure how all of the different processes relate to each other."
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,I think the session was so clear.
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,I would like to learn how to track version changes within the documents (.doc files etc) besides R scripts.
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,It is a lot to process and it would be a good idea to prepare extra task to do after the course
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"It went a little fast, and there are two projects (Learning R and Practice Repo), somehow I have problems to shift between the project files and open the right files. So it might be easier to focus on one project."
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,Maybe a few more minor breaks
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,Maybe it could have been integrated into the group work a bit more smoothly
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,More explanation
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,Nothing I can think of now.

Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,Some groupwork / discussion in plenum
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,We could maybe have been a bit more time
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,all good
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,having the session in an outdoor whirlpool ;) it would also be great to know how to use version control for other data types (e.g. word documents)
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"maybe a bit more practice with collaborative projects, to understand how to interact with other users of the same repositorium"
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"maybe a video showing the concept, how to do stuff"
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"maybe it would be easier to understand what the purpose of git and github is, if a real life example was included."
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,more coding along_ handson
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,slower pace with the explanations and code-alongs:-)
Day 2,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"tell what you would normally do - in what order would you do it. create project, github rep. etc."

Day 2,worked well for the Data visualization,It was interesting to see some of the different plots I wouldn't usually be exposed to.
Day 2,worked well for the Data visualization,"It was very nice to see what options are out there and how to plot and visualize different data types, since I haven't worked with R before and had no idea what options are out there."

Day 2,worked well for the Version control and collaborative practices,"It was great to know that there are dedicated programs for version control out there, since I haven't used Git before."

Day 2,worked well for the Version control and collaborative practices,"The message why git and GitHub are a really great idea to use came through, but it was very tricky to follow, since its a very different way to think. I also think the code along sessions about git/github went a little too fast - at least for me:-)"
Day 2,worked well for the Version control and collaborative practices,Very good lecture and good hands on.
Day 2,worked well for the Version control and collaborative practices,all good
Day 2,worked well for the Version control and collaborative practices,"clear and simple read in the course website about what are the advantages in using a program like Git for collaborative work, but also how useful it is for individual work. to follow along the instructions helps remembering what to do another time"
