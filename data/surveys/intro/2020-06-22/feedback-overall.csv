2020-06-24,I really liked the course and the structure of it but I would include more exercises to do after the course. And I think the instructors and helpers were really important to understand and solve problems in the course
2020-06-24,Awesome course! Great job to all instructors. Look forward to the advanced course. ;-)
2020-06-24,NIL - Was my favourite course I've taken so far! Thank you so much
2020-06-24,thanks
2020-06-24,More time for group project work.
2020-06-24,Having more pre-course materials to read helps a lot :)
2020-06-24,"Please, check the light and slides as I could not follow most of the presentation due to imbalance in light (two bright to show the slides).Please, increase the time for the group work as we had to jam different activities and more time will enable deeper understanding of the coding process."
2020-06-24,"It will be great if there is more time for the team work, we will be able to finish more work, and mimic the project in real life. The instructor and the helpers are super helpful, and study environment is also great."
2020-06-24,I think have more time for coding will be fun. Maybe with a reference allowing to spend more time doing plots or data clean up
2020-06-24,"From my perspective we have used too musch time in other programs than R, but it might come in handy in the future. Would have been nice though with a bigger focus on R"
2020-06-24,Very good with a three days course to cover the topics
2020-06-24,I could have used a bit more R-code on how to load data and basic things in RWe could in genereal have used a bit more time for the group work. It could be an idea to assign the groups a dataset to work with so we didn't have to spend time on that.It worked well to have three days in a row.
2020-06-24,"I liked the course a lot .I know this is not a statistical course, but it would have been nice to learn to do a few simple statistical analysis (instead of just doing figures). For instance a linear or logistic regression, a t-test or something and learning how to save them in a nice table.Instead of showing so many figures (which took quite a long time, you could go more into detail with one figure and the options. Could use a cookbook for how you start to work - save your data to r-format, load in data and then a simple analysis. We used the NHANES data a lot, but that was already there.Our data for the group work was not good - would be nice if you could provide a dataset, if groups cannot find them within a reasonable amount of time."
2020-06-24,"I am not sure if it is something applicable in an introduction course but I would like to learn how to handle datasets comprise of more than one file such as gene expression datasets etc. I would like to learn how to handle separate files together which would be something that I can use right away. Besides all the minor points, I appreciate time and effort of the organizers and instructors. It was a wonderful course and I really benefited from it. It was also very nice to meet with nice people. Thanks a lot!"
2020-06-24,"I felt there wasn't enough time to do the project. It became a bit confusing with creating a project individually and them link it to GitHub, so a suggestion could be to have the project management session directly followed by the Git session. Maybe we would not use R the first day, but this course is about more than R. Overall, it was a great course anyway!"
