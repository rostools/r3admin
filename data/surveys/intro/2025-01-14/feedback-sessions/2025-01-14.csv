"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Clearer instructions at the webpage. In general for the whole course: consider how much of the stuff we just read that needs to be said directly after. The start of the break was not honored.
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"I do not like that I have to press that many buttons to add and commit stuff to history, but for most participants at this course, I definitely think this is the right way to teach it. I can see that I can also just use the terminal but again, I think the way you are teaching it makes the most sense."
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"I do not understand what is going on with git yet, I'm getting more and more confused"
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,I would like more examples on how i can use git. I am not sure whether i should use it for anything other than my data-analysis.
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,I would rather more visualising at reading section
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,It was difficult to understand the Git session. There was a need for more instruction before the practice.
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,It's a little hard for me to understand the Git and how to process with it.
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Maybe a concrete example of when you use git? for exampel  is it good when you want to do several analysis on one dataset?
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Maybe highlight a bit more when adressing the pros/cons of git what sort of work can/cannot be managed with git. GDPR considerations etc.
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"More a general comment about teh entire day. I get why you wwant to setup the Git environment, Quarto etc, but maybe it would also be a nice solution to actually start by learning som R code to make things more relateble to what most people know already and then implmenet Git steadily. Also. considering the emphasis on the code of conduct actuelly during the day I got a little annoyed by the swearing (F-word)."
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,More examples and try to keep up the pace with previous section
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,More explanation of how /if this software is relevant for our daily work. More details about working with this version control when you work with personal data
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Nothing
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"Still a little bit hard to grasp what git is, and what actually happens when we commit something. And also, do we need to commit everything in our project - what happens if we don't? Perhaps it will become clearer later on in the course, but right now it's still a little bit confusing. So perhaps, try to make that a litlte clearer (or repeat it several times... I might just have missed it)."
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Still unsure if I will really use this tool
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"There is a lot of reading, but I guess that is the only option to understand how it works fully."

"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"Would have been nice to know how to setup Git in an unrelated project folder where it isn't automatic. I know you guys said that there are a multitude of ways, but maybe some are easier or harder to do, but an example would be nice."
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,a bit hard to follow
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,all good
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,could use a more thorough introduction - how to view the history when there are lots of commits to different files (filter by file?)
"Day 1, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"it would be easier just to stage and commit the same file more than once, instead of changing multiple files and setting tool which we want use."

"Day 1, morning part 1",could be improved for,Not much.
"Day 1, morning part 1",could be improved for,"Not much. Might be usefull with a note in the start on that we are not really starting with R yet during this session - but really not very important. AND - it was not clear from start that I should introduce my self to my table-friends. I could be visualized with a ""welcome-slide"" with three bullets at the screen.

"Day 1, morning part 2",could be improved for,nothing
"Day 1, morning part 2",could be improved for,"perhaps a list of word and their meaning. e.g. what is github, function, package etc."
"Day 1, morning part 2",worked well for,"A bit more hands on. When I read the text I don't understand it, 'cause I don't know what to use it for yet. But then, when there is an exercise, it makes more sense."
