"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Difficult understanding the reading tasks and the disadvantages with GitHub
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Faster flow
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,I just personally struggled a bit more due to an unknown kind of error but otherwise all good
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,I think we should have gone through the part about connecting your git to the github together as with many of the other tasks. I had trouble and didn't really got sufficient help until the hole session was almost over.
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,I'm not always sure if my screen looks like it should because we have been doing so much with different instructors so the instructors also have different outputs in RStudio.
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,It was great - 10/10 :)
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"It would be more intuitive to have the Connecting to GitHub explanation within the same page as the rest of information, right before 10.5 Synchronizing with GitHub instead of jumping to another tab"
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Maybe add the pre-course chap 9 directly to the course material?  Maybe not practical?
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"My functions for setting up github worked, I would have liked to know how to do it manually as well. The PAt was new to me and I think I sould have liked to have that introduced orally as well"
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Nice time schedule for this session. Shouldn't be much longer.
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Nothing
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Nothing for me
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Nothing.
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Perhaps installing a password manager during the pre course would be an advantage
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Reading about the personal access token and setting up github was not enough for me. I would have preferred the teacher to explain it beforehand and then maybe read and then the doing it.
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Skipped over some discussion about GDPR and also for registry data based studies GitHUb is not a possibility.
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,The setting up github took to long. There was a lot of waiting time for those who could do it right away. I suggest having some optional exercises that we could do individually in the waiting time
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"There were a lot of problems with making a token, so maybe spend more time on that"
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,Too much time for the github section.
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,don't know
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"more details on the workflow - how exactly is it ""powerful"" and better than eg. onedrive or tracked changes"
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,not sure
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,"nothing, I really liked it!"
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,overall really nice
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",could be improved for,too much Github. Would rather like more training in R - and not so much the collaboration part with Github etc
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,Easy to follow again. Good session.
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,Generally a good session.
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,Good amount of time for the Git exercise which was quite hard
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,"Great instruction and explanations, very easy to follow"
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,I liked the exercises
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,I think it's really helpful to know the Github and create it for myself

"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,It was nice with the code to easily setup github
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,It was perfect with much more practise
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,Lots of time to work on the subject for easier understanding
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,Most
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,Setting up Git on our own
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,The written guides were great and explanatory for the individuals codes.

"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,good that you have enough helpers so that no one falls behind
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,hands on experience with github concept
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,"more practical, less reading"
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,really nice pace. I think it's really nice we ourself have the opportunity to get familiar with GitHub and then you show us again.
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,the work with R
"Day 2, afternoon part 1",worked well for,timing is good
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,I found it a bit more difficult to follow. Maybe because of some accents.The part about boolean operators and the TRUE/FALSE part was confusing. I think if it is just explained with a clinical example then it is fine.Like:women & above 65 means ONLY woman above 65and:Woman | above 65 means ALL woman regardless of age and also people above age 65 regardless of sex
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,a bit overwhelming
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Overall really nice
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,a lot of hands-on experience
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,A little slow
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,All good
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,I could have used some more options in the visualisation.Maybe having spend a bit more time on showing code for some figures with x and y labels and using different colours etc.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,I think the session worked well
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"In general, I would have appreciated more explanation before we did code-along, because it is hard to remember things when you do not know why you are doing stuff. Unfortunaly, pronounciation of language is a challenge with this teacher, since it is makes it hard to follow and some parts of the teaching. This is not helping my learning. On the first part of the session (Day 2), the talk about logical conditions was started without context and for someone who have not used R, this is quite confusing. It was also confusing that it was said both ""and"" and ""or"" about the ""|"", which is unfortunate when introducing a new thing.  Further, the teaching sometimes continued even though not all green hats were up (=not everyone had finished). A suggestion for the exercises in this part, is to consider not to give away the template for the code (""___(___ >= ___ & ___ <= ___ & ___ == ___)"". It switches the focus from trying to remember how to do it and figure it out yourself, to focusing on to fill out blank spaces with the correct words. The template could be a hint."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"It would have been nice with an introduction to how to figure out the arguments of a function. So if I was to use a function not teached in this course, how do I know the arguments it needs?"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"Maybe expand a bit on the true, false and condition logic in R, as I think this is an important thing to understand - in my opinion the explanation was a bit short."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,More excercises
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,Nothing
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,Nothing for me.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,Nothing. :)
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,Please take some time to listen a bit more to the questions the participants have.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"Text strings and variable names could be explained better. Like when to use ""..."" and when to not use ""..."". When is it considered a variable, like a column and when do we split the variable name. the ""PG""-part"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"The explanation of Logic was explained in a confusing way for those who haven't used R or coded before, This lead to long waits. in addition you have to make sure that you understand what people are asking for before answering them"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,The reading section should have been more elaborated
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,could be nice with exercises without templates too.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,it was ok - i guess i was wanting to now more in depth about how to manipulate date in some specific ways that is perhaps more for the intermediate
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,it workedd well
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,maybe an overview of the used functions?
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"more difficult tasks, maybe some without the ""fill in codes"""
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,nothing it is good
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,the basics of logic was a bit long and I would expect unnecessary
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,use more time on answering questions
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",could be improved for,"was a bit fast. teacher should repeat instructions several times, so if you are struggling, you get another chance to hear the instruction."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Good examples using the data
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Good tempo. Good with many repetitions.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Great session. Nice and useful tools introduced. Good teacher!
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"I like that there where more exercises, where we had to try out things own our own."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,I like the tasks in this part
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"I think the part of the function of the mutate,rename and filter is relly nice."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,It was fast to do it and had a great flow
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Many exercises on our own.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Plenty of exercises are fun. Thank you
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,Relevant
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,The excersises.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,The exercises were really nice to practice and fully understand how these functions work
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,The flow again was fine and the live coding sessions is ok.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,The functions we are learning are important and I can see how they can be usefull for me.
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"The instructor was great, and the time allocated was enough"
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,The tasks

"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,good pace and good exercises
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,good with practice yourself
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"good with the helpers. explaining ""why"" as much as possible is good! gives me hooks and logic to remember things by."
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,it was a nice exercise
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,it was really good to code along the instructor!
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,nice pace
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,"very easy to understand the separation of functions related to ""rows"" and ""columns"""
"Day 2, afternoon part 2",worked well for,well done. Nice with the exercises!
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,Brush up of how to open our project in r studio
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,Clearness about open the project from yesterday in R before starting exercises. In general I needed to be held in hand more to follow the few exercises we were doing.
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,"Could probably spend a bit less time on this particular subject, to give more time for others"
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,Emphasize on the different options to show or not messages and warnings. Get some examples on error messages and how to solve them
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,I think it would be better if we can talk more about the data managemant.
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,"I think the environment with the variables should be introduced when we have to go through the dataset. It might not be relevant for this exercise but I think it is the easiest way of getting a feel for a dataset, when I can scroll through columns and rows"
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,I would rather less summary after we read since we already read
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,I'm not done with the reading when we stop.
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,"It was evident that not all had openede the projects from yesterday or loaded the dataset. Also, I guess at least for me it would have been nice to be introduced to tools that could help fix the problems in the dataset otr at least to be told that these will be presented later. E.g. how to automaticalli switch between long and wide format, rename in bulk, ad value labels etc.."
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,Maybe more about how to import different dataset (excell) and how that look in R.
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,Maybe trying some different commands on our code to see what the effect is - such as echo
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,More example for tidy or messy data could be helpfull especially for long format table :) (more complex example would help)
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,More excercises
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,Nothing
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,Nothing.
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,"Nothing. Really nice with an ""easy"" morning session. A little reading, a littele explanation, a little chat in groups. Nice!"

"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,found it all very nice
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,maybe few examples on how to navigate through cheath sheets
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,"more sessions where we discuss with each other throughout the course! :) I am still lacking a good understanding of like the meta-stuff. What does the it mean to enter something in the different panes, what is saved, what is not, what is the ""working space"", what is the results..? I don't have the right names or questions for it yet, and reading or hearing about it is good, but when I am forced to articulate something (like when discussing with other student) it becomes clearer."
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,nothing I guess
"Day 2, morning part 1",could be improved for,sometimes you forgot to make us put on the green hat after doing something practical
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,"""what is wrong with the data"" discussion was great"
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,A run through of a data set and how to make it more tidy
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,All of it
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,As always nice to go over the most important points from the reading sessions in plenum.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Discussion with neighbours
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Good explanation of data tidyness
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,I got into more - I have faced with error and got help.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,I like the speed of things at it is so lovely that you go over the reading material to be sure everyone understood it correctly
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,I think the tidy data is relly useful for me to condudct something in the project.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,It was a really nice session. It was great looking at the dataset to see the problems in the structure.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Looking at the dataset and finding the messy things.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Nice level of the stuff we were learning for a morning session. In general Luke is a very nice teacher.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,"Nice to start of easy at the beginning of the day, also by doing some repetition from yesterday."
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Pace was perfect to follow and understand each step of importing data
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Reading sessions was good
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Slow tempo. You said several times yesterday that it is reading-heavy. I think it is a perfect amount of reading :)
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,Talking about tidy data with neighbors and in the big group to get a feeling for what it actually is/means.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,The assesment of data (tidy vs messy)
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,The flow of the presentation was good. And it was a good summary of what occurred the day before.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,The website and ready exercises
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,code along
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,good discussion session looking at a real dataset
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,"good exercise to think about the data- I'm new to R / tidy, so good to reflect"
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,good explanations
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,good rythm
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,really good recap of yesterdays work
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,the discussion part with each other.
"Day 2, morning part 1",worked well for,well paced
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"Before we begin the course, recommend people who are more analog to print a cheat sheet with relevant codes"
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,Even more tools and practice on how to make figures.
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,Having a split screen so that the output could be seen together with the code? maybe having the output in the viewer pane besides the source pane?
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,I would have liked more time to play around with the graphs
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"If instructor answers questions in plenum, try to keep the room quiet and not as noisy, or maybe repeat the question out loud"
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,It could have been slower
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,It seemed more unclear from the instructor what the goals were
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,Jumping between course material and Rstudio was a little too fast sometimes and confusing
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,Maybe a bit slow and at some points uncertain explainations. Be a bit more certain with what you are saying.
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,None
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,Nothing
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,Nothing for me
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"Putting more effort into explaining the basic prinicples of the code ""terminology"" before explaining the code itself could save you the mountain of questions you got during the sesssion"
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"Remember to be consistent with naming. Also perhaps specify, that for a code string to run, you have to be sure that all variable names are identical to the variable name in the data frame. Especially, considering the data we are working with is a bit messy and has big letter at the beginning of a variable, which easily messis things up if one is not aware of it."
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"The start was a bit confusing, not understanding if an exercise was initiated or if we were just shown some stuff. It was a learning session for the teacher, so it is expected not to run as smooth as earlier, but it ended up being a bit confusing throughout the session and it didnt help my learning."
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"When a single student gets help at the same time as the teacher answers a question out loud, it is hard to hear :) maybe wait with questions in plenum to all student are ready?"
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"i think the concept of labeling to allow referencing in html is a little foreign for most, as this is not something you would use for a traditional word-file based manuscript. A little more xplaination of this would be nice. Also generally maybe it would be nice to sometimes present the result (the graph) and then talk about the steps needed to get there and not just say ""now we need to do a two cont graph"" and then start with the first line if the code. Just to prime people on the steps that follows to get from nothing to nice graph. As per this i believe some of this could have been on day 1 and some of the gut stuff could have come on later."
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"it was very, very slow. More time to just play around with it"
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"maybe one more short break, 5 min, in this session, as it is more code heavy, and I needed to focus more here during this session."
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,more info about syntax for also changing axis etc.
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,nothing
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,ok for now
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,overall fine
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,the instructor needs to tell all the steps which makes it more easier to follow
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,the rythm and the structure was a bit more chaotic but it is really no big deal - just because I have to say something that could potentially be improved :)
"Day 2, morning part 2",could be improved for,"went a bit fast at times. good thing to repeat instructions several times i.e. ""so insert new code chunk, *pause* insert new code chunk, everybody inserted a new chunk?"""
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Easy to follow :) Tempo was good.
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,"For me,the part of ggplot is pretty important and intersting."
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,It is nice that it was so much hands-on coding
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,It was good to get to make a lot of different figures and realize it was not that hard.
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,It was great with less reading and more practising
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,It was great!
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Nice to learn about ggplot
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,"Nice walk-throug. Nice pace. Very nice to be able to look up the code in the 'recipe' Luka had sent out, so we were able to code along at our own pace"
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Nice with hands-on practice with the teacher as a guide. Great session!
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Playing with different plot options (guided)
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,The actual mangling with data
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,The explainations of the code and how the individual ggplot functions and calls do was fine.
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,The hands on
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,"The mic, Ole speaks not that loud"
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Thorough explanation of plots are incredibly useful
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,"Very good tempo, patience. I liked the examples, and how I could follow both the teacher and the material for auditory/visual learningI also like that the data-set is not ""perfect"" so we learn about real world data"
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Very nice session
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,Very relevant
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,"You got an idea of how to change your plots, and thus use them for your own data"
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,"a lot of exercises , really  good idea"
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,code along works great. nice to work with data
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,differentiate between the difference plots
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,impressive to see how quick and easy it is to make plots
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,nice built-up and good pace
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,showing step by step what to write in code for the exercises.
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,well paced. well introduced
"Day 2, morning part 2",worked well for,"works well by gradually adding functions to a graph, stepwise making it more complex."
