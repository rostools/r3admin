"Day 2, afternoon",could be improved for,I think the session was adequate.
"Day 2, afternoon",could be improved for,I thought it was great. Maybe more exercises e.g. for individual work while others are getting help? Don't know if that would work.

"Day 2, afternoon",could be improved for,It would have been nice to see if you could have the mean + SD besides each other in a table (I know this is not the topic)
"Day 2, afternoon",could be improved for,Maybe a few visual examples for what Quarto documents can be used for.

End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,I have no good ideas
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"Is felt kind of rushed. You were encouraged to go for a walk outside, but the questions were so long, that no one in the group could actually remember the course. Maybe the conversation shouldn't be fixed, but instead the time could be set aside for a walk, or just simply social time with your tables mates."
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Maybe some non R-related stuff. There are not that many breaks.

End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,We had much time to talk amongst ourselves and discuss more.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,"Well, we did not do much. Just chatted with others randomly. I do not think we have discussed what was planned for the social activity sessions; but still, that was pretty fun."
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,good to meet fellow students
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,"interestingly prepared tasks for the ""Neyworking Activities"", and changing the table every day works well and significantly contributes to communication."
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,it was nice to sit with different people almost everyday and share our experiences.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,"we did not have so musch experience with version controls and stuff, but we had a great discussion about git"
