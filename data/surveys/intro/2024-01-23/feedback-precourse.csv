"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I watched a ""code along"" introduction on youtube which took 20-30 min. Afterwards a read the precourse material again, and it made much more sense to me the second time. Maybe it is possible to incorporate something like that."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe a bit confusing with all the links. Sometimes difficult to remember which section you were at.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe some videos with explainations with audio.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","My observation trying to learn programming and data analysis is that even as a beginner you require so much background knowledge to be able to follow even the simplest videos or instructions. Even though the material is easy to follow, there are always several links one has to click to read, to understand certain concepts and in those links, you find even more links for further reading. This makes it sometimes challenging to follow one specific task or material to its end and get back to exactly where you were and why you ended up on some page. A general beginner's guide could be provided for us beginners to study before starting with the pre-course material."

"In your opinion, what could be improved?",So far so good
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Some aspects were a bit jumpy in the sequence of doing things. Not a dealbreaker though
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The output of the codes I was asked to run was different and much longer than the examples in the material, which confused me a bit. This could be handled by stating that it may look different (if that is the case)."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The part of installing R, Rstudio, ect.: A note on whether you just have to choose the recommended options in the installation guide."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",The pre-course survey should be available earlier.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",eventually small exercices
