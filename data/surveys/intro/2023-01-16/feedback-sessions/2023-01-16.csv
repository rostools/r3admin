Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,Everything was fine.
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,Good maybe go a bit faster sometimes
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"I believe that less reading, more code along would be better. But I understand that most people won't read ahead and explaining may take too much time."
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,I cannot think of a change. Definitely practe is needed but maybe that comes on day 2.
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,I dont have a specific value add suggestion here. Maybe regular breaks would be nice. Just trying to be critical here as I cannot think of anything else at the moment.
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,I have no idea.
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,I have no suggestion so far.
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"I like most of it, but I felt the introduction felt quite long.There was a lot of explanation on what we were gonna do, instead of actually doing it."
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,I think everything was good.
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,I think it was a good start as it is.
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"I think the timing could be improved - we seemed to run over the intended time, and so didn't have enough time to sort out issues with the GitHub section in the afternoon."

Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,The reading and postit worked well. I
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,There were quite few breaks which made it hard to concentrate towards the end. There was also a lot of reading which was gard to focus on towards the end of the day.
Day 1,could be improved for the Management of R projects,"before: maybe introduce the app ""CampusInfo"" for finding places at chalmers and GU"

Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"A tiny bit slower pace, sometimes it was hard to type as fast as the teacher"
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"As a new and somehow complicated process in the beginging, I would prefer the instructor should show us the steps first, then we do it by reading the text."
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"Creating learning-github repo (1st repo) ended in nothing. we are asked to try to make a new project in R based on this repo but then are asked to get the token and then use it for LearningR, so learning-github just ends up being unused. Also we are taught on how to make learning-github (repo via github) private, but not LearningR (repo via R) so it is public by default. I suggest including the instruction on making it private explicitly."
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,Difficulties while setting up github.. Hopefully will fix that tomorrow

Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,Good maybe go a bit faster sometimes

Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,I'm happy with the knowledge I got today.
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,It made more sense than the times I tried to understand it by my own. Maybe spending more time during the course on this will increase general understanding of GitHub use.
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"It was already good, but more practice examples with a few more steps/changes would be fun :)"
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"It was to late. I am not able to stay focused for such long days. So, I did the exercise and everything works but I really do not record why or what I'm doing. So really don't learn anything. But this is more of a time schedule issue than anything else."
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,It was well organised and structured.

Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,Schedule and timekeeping
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"Since git is new for most people, I feel that this specific part can have more verbal explanation rather than reading. I feel a verbal explanation of important concepts before reading can help. However, I felt it all worked very well regardless."
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"Sometimes it is a little bit difficult to really understand what you are doing in the practical tasks. I felt I was just doing what I was told, especially in the end of the session. I also think an earlier break would have been helpful to avoid getting too tired."
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,Speed of the session
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,The Github submit and commit could be explained a bit slower or a bit more step by step. I was able to ask my peers so it all worked out:)
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"The linking a local repository to GitHub section had some complications, and there wasn't enough time to debug them."
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"There were times where we were reading and doing the task and then after reading it we did the exact same thing together. This felt like a little bit of waste of time. Since the last parts were very hands on, maybe just a demonstration without the reading would be better."
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"Too much time dedicated to reading. In the provided materials there's no indication, which exercises we should or should't do, so naturally most people finished with reading followed with exercises."
Day 1,could be improved for the Version control and collaborative practices,"While I think it was easy to follow and not to fast, the morning was an easier topic so maybe spend more time on the version control and slightly less on the management of R projects session."
