"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,Everything went fine
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,"How everything integrates together to build the website is still a little unclear to me, I might have problems customizing it. Maybe some examples of different options you could put on the website might be helpful?"
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,"I could be cool to see what possibilities there are for the webpage, e.g. drop down menus, buttons and more"
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,I think it worked well and had a suitable length
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,Lets do RShiny now :-))
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,"Maybe it would be useful/nice to get more general knowledge of how to write the _quarto.yml file (indentation, hyphens (how, what, why) and all the different options for how to build a website)."
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,"Nothing, it was all really well"
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,Reference(s) to design and tailor your website in quarto would be nice :)

"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,Was faster than what was in the programme.. or maybe we just skipped the networking.
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,"We skipped the discussion about why we should share. That would have been nice, but maybe a bit of a tangent."
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,a bit more detail on how to add/delete/edit website could be nice
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,a bit more time to explore github
"Day 3, afternoon",could be improved for,first part of the session was a bit messy with the lecturer keep asking if we have been able to do it instead of using the sticker system. She picked it up later however! :)

"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,1. Assignment 8.4 was a bit weird. 2. It was quite confusing with pipes in the pipes in the pipes.
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,A bit slow at some points
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,All good
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"Build in some ways of minimizing despair! It is SOOOO confusing with the almost-but-not-quite-the-same names for dfs and objects when moving between the quarto code and functions, testing the function in quarto, then writing it into targets. Maybe having some prefix/suffix to the naming to indicate that this is a preliminary name while building the code, which corresponds EXACTLY to the final name used in the function code? Also it is extremely frustrating that the instructor continues when you are working on an issue with a helper, then you are continuously behind and might not have done all steps of the next chunk, which then gives an issue for the next chunk, then you are behind again etc. etc."
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"I have nothing to add. The session worked well over discord. Although, it is best to physically be there."
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"I think it gets a little bit hard to remember the functionality of all the functions, and thus becomes confusing"
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"I though this session was abit confusing, not due to the instructor, but due to the switching back and forth between making functions and using functions we made in another function. As well as I think we should have started up this morning by cleaning up the markdown document, and ensure everybody had the same in that document, as it caused problems for some during the first exercise where we had to run targets on our own"
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,Lecturer seemed a bit unfamiliar with the topic she presented
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"Maybe it would be relevant to work with your own project, and try to implement to tools for your own projects."
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"Nothing, it was very good"
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"One doesn't really think to much in these sessions, as it is just code-along all the way, without really learning anything new. So it would be nice with some more explanation for the analyses or otherwise maybe groupwork on how to solve an exercise like this. Or making a different session learning different/new tools like in the beginning of yesterday (Wednesday)."
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,Repetition on df transformation from the previous session
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"The learning qmd started to get messy, maybe it could have been a bit clearer what was going to be deleted vs. what was not."

"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,maybe work in teams will building the workflow
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,no points
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,plot design could be updated
"Day 3, morning",could be improved for,"targets make everything a little complicated to keep track of. I got a bit confused as to what function did what to the data, especially as we did something similar yesterday and some of those exercises remained in the quarto"
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,Everything
"Day 3, morning",worked well for,Everything ran smoothly and the session had a nice pace

End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Better weather
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Could use it to have a broader discussion on implementation of the methods when you get home.
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Depends on what the aim is exactly - but it would be nice with something a bit more active. Maybe during a session rather than right after lunch?
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,I don't really have any ideas
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,I think the 2nd day social activities were a little random..
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,I think the most useful networking for me was during the meals and the daily mixing of groups (and that was very good). I think you could consider cutting the networking and maybe change it to reflection questions done in the groups during the sessions
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,I was good as is
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,Not really
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"Nothing, it works well to get the conversation going"
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"One on the last day. AAnddn maybe just more personal things, like who we are etc."
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"The questions could, IMO, be less R/course centered. Would also be nice just to have some random and more personal questions"
End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,"There are still some people I didn't interact with, purely out of chance due to the seating arrangements."

End of course,could be improved for the Networking Activities s,no suggestions

End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,Good with the walk and talk.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,Having them around lunch time was good because we were already kind of chatting with each other. It was a good way to find out what other people are working on.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,"I found it hard to notice when a networking activity had started or not, and it felt a bit tossed on in the end"
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,I think it was some very nice questions - I liked the work and talk
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,I was not so good at using them I must admit.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,It is good to have the questions to start the conversation
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,It was easy to approach other participants and instructors
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,It was good to get some fresh air!
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,It was nice to get a chance to talk to the other participants on the course

End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,That we could walk and talk.
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,Was good to hear other people's experiences in similar situations. Now i have a better understanding on how other people deal with certain situations that I used to struggle with
End of course,worked well for the Networking Activities s,questions were very easy to initiate conversation and get  into getting a more personal opinion/experience
