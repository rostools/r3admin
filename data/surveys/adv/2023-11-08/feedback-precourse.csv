"In your opinion, what worked well?",All is well stated
"In your opinion, what worked well?","All of it! It was nice and easy to follow. Even though I have taken the previous courses, the links back to the topics that are important for this course, really help to make me feel more prepared for the course, as I could make sure to read it an extra time if I feel like I need it."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Amazing
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Complete overview of tasks and survey. A wall of text can be overwhelming, but braking it down works very well"
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Easy to follow instructions
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything is thoroughly and well explained. It is nice to know that we all have everything ready and set up to start the course effectively.

"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything went smooth
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Everything worked well
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I think step wise instructions and copy paste code is helpful. Discriptions were good as well.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I thought it was very straight forward and well structured.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Ish, I had trouble installing the packages. I have only used local RStudio on this computer for the Intro and Intermediate course and r3 was not installed, and trying to install it resolved in error because ""Personal git token expired"". Fresh install of RStudio resolved the problem."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","It is very easy to follow and the ""copy and paste this code"" sections make sure that everyone will likely be able to complete the tasks on their own."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","It's super clearly described, and easy to navigate in"
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Step-by-step guidance, and reassurance that even if it doesn't work, we will sort it out."

"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I had trouble installing homebrew, which made for a challenge to me. Maybe a few words on how to use homebrew / what the package offers would be great"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I have no good suggestions - I think it works really well :)
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I think every thing was clear so far, so I think that will depend on the actual course. If it lives up to my expectations from the material."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think this needs a change? r3::create_rmarkdown_doc() --> Error: 'create_rmarkdown_doc' is not an exported object from 'namespace:r3' r3::create_rmd_doc()
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","I'm not sure why I got an error on the last check, I'm pretty sure the project is set up correctly"

"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The 5-7 hours expected time for the pre-course tasks is daunting - it might help to break it down to 1h of reading, 1h of going over sections in previous courses, 1-4 hours of installing and updating software, 20 min survey."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","You would like us to better understand the dataset, to make it a bit easier to understand what kind of data we are looking at, one could perhaps include a small introduction to what the data is, such as including this line from the abstract, in the first part of 3.9. ""Download the course data"": ""We’re going to use a real world dataset to demonstrate the concepts in this course. We’re going to use an openly licensed dataset with metabolomics data. Specifically, this data contains lipidomic profile of red blood cells from type 1 diabetes patients and matched healthy controls was determined by NMR spectroscopy"" or something like that :-)"
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",i think it is very good already
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","line 9 of r3::check_project_setup_advanced() looks for an "".rda"" but we save a "".csv"""
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","nil, i think my problems was due to RStudio magic and probably out of scope on this survey."
