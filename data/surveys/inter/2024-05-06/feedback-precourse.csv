"In your opinion, what worked well?",All of it worked super well.
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Being new to Git and GitHub I had a lot of problems on this part. So the links to the intro course are very nice, as following this made some of the pre-course much easier. In general easy to follow instructions. I really like the ways to check if you did it correctly throughout, instead of finishing the section and then finding out it was ""wrong""."

"In your opinion, what worked well?","I like that there where multiple options for some parts of the code that might not work, that shows you have experience with the code and how it acts for others."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","I liked the layout of the material, with clear headings and sections/section types."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I really liked the materials and I found them very complete and easy to follow
"In your opinion, what worked well?",I was able to install the software on my own personal computer and could finish the tasks in good time.

The pre-course tasks made me look forward to the course because it is exactly targeting my knowledge gab.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Including images and easy-to-copy Rcode made it quite easy to follow along. Links to the basic course was helpfull as well.
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Interesting to use some packages and functions I haven't used before
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Ligesom sidste kursus, så er det godt at lige kører nogle ting igennem og få en ide om det kodningssprog og tankerne der ligger bag. Både godt at få styr på software før - og at få lidt forhåndsviden pre course."

"In your opinion, what worked well?",N/A

"In your opinion, what worked well?","Overall the material is well structured, well described and easy to understand."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",Overall the material is well written
"In your opinion, what worked well?","Overall, everything worked. And there were useful tips on what to do or not to do. As I hadn't taken the Introductory course, I had to switch to and back from several Introductory course topics, and sometimes I got lost between them - what steps I had actually covered. But that was nothing unmanageable."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The clear step by step instructions and the provided code. It is nice to have the task provided as a text you can do while reading along. However, it is very important that the ""check up"" outputs are provided to make sure everything went as supposed.Further, i love the simple look."
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The course materials are clear, and I appreciate knowing what exactly to type in the console and the script."
"In your opinion, what worked well?",The explanations of the tasks and pre-course coding language
"In your opinion, what worked well?","The guided walkthrough of the precourse tasks works great.

"In your opinion, what could be improved?",.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",?
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Adjust the course and explanation to real beginners because still complicated and not explicit enough to follow when you never used R before. Could add some videos too.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","At this point, nothing. everything worked as it should, and I did not encounter any trouble along the way."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Consider notifying about the deadline for the precourse tasks in the acceptance text

"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I like it overall!
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",I think visualise them in form of the video could also help increase the number of people paying closer attention to the material

"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Jeg er lidt forvirret over at oprette endnu et projekt der hedder LearnR3 (har jo en fra første kurses), så jeg har operettet en der hedder LearnR4 istedet."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Maybe have the links open up in a new tab automatically so that you don't loose the site and where you are when opening the many links that are included in the course text

"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Not all what is written is seen in my R studio
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Not much.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Not that much to be fair. Might consider shorten the amount of text, as it sometimes can be confusing with ""too much"" text information. Otherwise a small note or mark of which of the precourse task can be skipped if you participated in the recent R3 intro course. (e.g. ""if you have participated in R3 intro, you can go directly X.X and check setup)."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing so far.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing to declare for now.

"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Nothing.
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","Since I did not have any knowledge with Git before doing this, I first had issues connecting Git with R because I did not open it while using R. After I opened it everything worked well. I had issues installing Rtools on my work computer which is why I need to use my personal computer instead."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?",Sometimes a bit difficult to understand the task because more text/explantations were shown below the code or a picture
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The only thing was getting access from SDU to download the packages needed. You could consider providing a guide on how to do it on UCloud, as the SDU limitations would not be a problem then."
"In your opinion, what could be improved?","The set up of the website was a bit confusing. I.e., sometimes linking to new pages, even though the same text was further down the page"
