"In your opinion, what could be improved?",the link to https://r-cubed-intermediate.rostools.org/preamble/#licensing doesnt work

Please describe the problems you've had.,"When installing R packages, the pak::pak(""rostools/r3"") command gave me an error, but running remotes::install_github(""rostools/r3"") instead helped."
Please describe the problems you've had.,"i got an error message when i tried to install pak::pak(""rostools/r3""), but it doesnt work because i havent generated personal account token in Github before that. after i generated the personal token, link it with my GIt (googled a bit how to do it because i dont remember), restarted the R, then did it again, it worked. perhaps these steps can be made clearer in the pre-course task."
