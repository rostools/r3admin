2023-06-21,"It was a great course, but what I miss during the days is the option to make yourself notes. In this course, we are deleting some parts of the code, so it is difficult to go back and look into your errors or what should pay more attention to. Not sure if there will be a possibility to add notes or comments. Also, we were a mixed group, and some parts were a bit more rush than I would have liked. This is not my main activity, but I hope I can now start looking at how to apply it to my data."
