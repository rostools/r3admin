Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","For me it was a bit too slow in the way that importing data is more ""boring"" than writing functions, which we did not get to until around 13.30-14. Maybe copy-paste code from online material instead of writing everything?"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","I can't think right now, my brain is fried"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",I think I need a bit more information on why each of the steps are important/useful
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","I think it would be nice to reduce the dependency on external (or extra) packages, trying to increase the utilities included in R already (utils, base, stats packages)"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",I'm sometimes missing the point of certain steps and just copy the code and see that it works… so maybe some explanation?
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","In general, not just for ""Basic setup and workflow"" it might be helpful if the keyboard shortcuts for macbooks could be mentioned as they seem to be different - but that's a minor thing, one can of course find out by going to the correct buttons to look it up or just by trying it out"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",It was OK
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",It was good
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","It would be nice with a small introduction before each new subject so we get the bigger picture / purpose of the coding. Moreover, it would be nice with a general explanation of git. I have difficulties in understanding the concept even after reading material from intro-course."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Maybe some optional exercises if you finish early? I had some time to spare and got a little bored
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Nothing
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Nothing that I can think of right now.
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Nothing, I think it worked ver nicely."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Some technical problems, but other than that all good"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","The room is not great (it easily gets a bit loud when instructors help while one is presenting) - this has nothing to do with the course itself, but more the surroundings."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",The room made it difficult to listen to the lectures while people got help.
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",it has been great
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","Again, maybe try to use basics R functions instead of package-derived, for reproducibility"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","Exercises got a little repetetive, I did not feel it was necessary to do it for all four data sets."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","I am still finding it difficult to understand how all of this information fits together (e.g., packages, functions, arguments), so I could use a bit more of an overview or more context-setting before we jump into the code-alongs"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",In general this has been great. One thing that could be improved: I would have liked the functions was related to not importing data but rather data cleaning problems.
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","It might be difficult to apply to own data because of little explanation of different packages and functions. But then again, very small thing considering that it is probably easier to understand these things when reading it for yourself."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",It was a bit hardcore for the afternoon session.
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","It's a bit tricky getting an overview of the main functions of the different packages, when you have never heard about them before - but don't think this necessarily can be changed."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",Maybe more exercises with less explicit help in the text would be useful as a next step to further practise using the code just learned
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",More reading materials for pre-course tasks
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",Nothing that I can think of right now.
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",Nothing to report.
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","Nothing, I think it works well"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",The last exercise was tough with a fried brain! Maybe better to give a little more help OR wait for next morning to recap with a fresh brain
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",The most intense part was at the end of the day so we were a bit tired. It would be better if there would be a way to do these exercises with fresher minds .
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",The same as above
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","The second half went really fast and I got a little bit lost, plus it felt like a big jump between the content taught and our final exercise but maybe that just reflects a decent challenge/learning"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",same as above. Especially the end of the session was difficult and the late hour made me quite unfocused
