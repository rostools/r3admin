Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","I very much crave to know what actually happens when one runs a function, which I did not get to know from the lecture itself. As an example, I would have loved to know that what vroom actually does it that it builds upon reader, where it can automatically detect the file type and structure. Also, for example that fs is just basically a package that enables streamlined terminal commands independent of the terminal environment. I fell like this could very easily be fixed, by just briefly talking what the package does and why it is useful when first introducing them."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","I have quite a lot of functions, so while there weren't anything I did not understand I do have a suggestion for improvement which I believe could improve the comprehension of what a function actually is and how it works. It was briefly touched upon with the add_numbers function, but I think it would have been great, to take a function like mean, and recreate using different methods.For example, first showing the easy way by using sum/ count. But then also show it done by creating a loop where you manually count and keep the sum in a buffer - not because one should do it like this, but rather to demystify what a function actually does."
Day 1,"worked well for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Introduced the vroom package to me. Also found the fs and here package to be useful. Also, in general, the code-along with the stickers seems like a very good way to ensure people are following along."
Day 1,"worked well for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","I did not know about the roxygen skeleton thing, so it was nice to get that introduced."
