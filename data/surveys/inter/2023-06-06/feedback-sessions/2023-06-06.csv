Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","A little fast going through it. Would be nice if you said what we are suppose to use it for, just in a few words. It was did sometimes (nice), but not always."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Can't think of anything
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",I don't know
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",I got a little lost in the spec/vroom part - the work flow was confusing until I think the last exercise. Could maybe be explained a little more in the beginning
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",I had problems because I didn't do some of the pre-course tasks. I think I may have followed some of the tasks from the beginner course on accident as I was reading.
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","I think it could be made a bit clearer in the beginning why we had to do the workflow in ""importing data fast"". It became clear eventually, but at first I felt a bit confused as to why we were putting so much emphasis on it."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",I think we are losing a lot of time by people not being prepared for the course
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",If we had looked at the data before today
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Make sure that the pre course tasks cannot be completed without installing github (I somehow missed downloading the program)
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Maybe for those who have finished the tasks and are waiting for the ""orange stickies"" to not be there anymore, having some additional voluntary exercises would be a good idea. Otherwise, for those who have no problems have to wait a bit."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Maybe visualise eg with view after a data import so we get more of a sense of what we were importing
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Mayby start with the data set and let us discuss what is the point of importing it - what are we going to ""use"" it for (therorethically)"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",Mostly relevant if you have very large datafiles

Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","Overview ""what have we done now.."" more visual"
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","There could be more explanation on the different steps in the workflow and what each function does (in short, simple terms)."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","There was quite a bit of wait time for those who had everything working right away, but still had to wait for those with issues."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s","This session is a neccesary evil, it was fine."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Basic setup and workflow and Importing data, fast s",exercise time should be increased.

Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",Hard to think of anything
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",I think It was pretty great as is :D
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","I think it could also be a bit clearer why we went through the ""functions.R"" file and ""DESCRIPTION"" file, it made somewhat sense when I read through the website, but not really sense as I was doing it."
Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions",I think the setup of the screen could be improved..

Day 1,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Making functions","Maybe for those who have finished the tasks and are waiting for the ""orange stickies"" to not be there anymore, having some additional voluntary exercises would be a good idea.
