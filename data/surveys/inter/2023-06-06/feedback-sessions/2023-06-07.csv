Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Explain more about the different files we uses (.R, .qmd and Description) and why we use them"
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Heavy part, in the end of the day."
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Here i missed the beginners course
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"I felt that this session was rushed a little, but I believe we will continue it tomorrow. The session is very interesting, but having it very late throughout the day made it a little more difficult to follow along. Luckily, through the well written syllabus, I will read up on it later tonight at a little slower tempo."
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,I missed this part
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"I think it might be good with a few more examples of why you'd need to do processing and joining datasets for cleaning. I know that for my case it made a lot of sense, but for my sidebuddy, it wasn't quite clear."
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,It has not finished yet
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"It was a little fast at the end, especially since it was at the end of the day and our brains might have been a little bit fried"
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Maybe slow down a little bit at some points when you write. It was a bit fast sometimes, at least for me. But this is minor things and I was quickly back on track, although I may have missed some of the information."

Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,fine
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"it was a loooong day at the end. At some point we had to write some functions again we already wrote earlier, and were told to delete them - that seemed weird."
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,maybe some recap. take home mesaages.
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,n/a
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,no comments
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"no complaints :D I tried to think of something, I really did"
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,only did the reading
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,teacher goes a little to fast when typing in R
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",.maybe some recap. Take home messages. background for the structure of the functional
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Could be a bit longer with a few more examples but not necessary
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Day too long to focus even though you try to break it up:)
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Drop the social activity to shorten the day
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Fast pace sometimes to fast.
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","For most of the times this worked well, but at some cases the teacher forgot to ask whether everybody had the same or any problems. Then it is easy to get behind"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Honestly, I really felt frustrated about this session. The concept of doing stuff in the qmd file and then delete it entirely was a bit frustrating - we did not get the point of using both the qmd and R file. It was also a bit annoying that we wrote over things we just wrote. And lastly, I think you should make sure for next time, that everyone has downloaded the data correctly"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",I did not feel like the strengths and important points of functionals was highlighted in class
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",I don't know
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","I thought it was a bit difficult to understand as we went along why we were doing what we were doing. It more just felt like a code-along without actual understanding in between steps, and I don't know if it was because we were rushed for time or not. I know it's a difficult topic though, and I suspect that it will make more sense when you're sitting with your own data."
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",I'm honestly still confused about the hiccup with the files that we were supposed to delete
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","It felt like the exercises part was moving a bit too fast even tho some people were stuck into some issues with the code - since we are time constricted, maybe a  heads up of ""we will move on in 3 minutes, cope from the solutions"" would be nice, so we are ready to start when the instructors want to move on"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Maybe more time for questions or makeing sure that everyone follows
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",Not much

Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",The whole confusion about deleting the mmash folder was very time consuming
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",This session felt like it took a very long time.
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",maybe we could moove a lttle bit faster. too much time with the un-zip part. skip the social-activities
