2023-06-08,It was a great course! Really enjoyed it
2023-06-08,"This course is just absolutely great. It's hard to pinpoint specific parts, but the entire setting, mood, teachers and materials are really optimal for learning coding."
2023-06-08,nope :D
2023-06-08,"Cake AND chocolates, and not just chocolates."
2023-06-08,"I said the same thing last time, I think this is an excellent course and has given me a lot of tools and ideas to move forwards with, so I just want to say thank you and look forwards to the next one."
2023-06-08,Nice with time to do hands-on on own data with your help available
2023-06-08,"This, together with the R3-intro course are the best courses I have ever taken. So well structured !!"
2023-06-08,"It would be nice if 2 two minutes warning was given before the exercises ends, just so that if you did not finish you can copy the code form the course book and be ready to follow along :)"
2023-06-08,Great course. Good teachers. A fantastic positive enviroment to learn.
2023-06-08,Lovely days! See you at advanced!!
2023-06-08,"I would like each session with a more cleare 'take home message'. i know there was a summary, but still.Maybe a hand-out with som e of the basic stuff explained (maybe in danish:))"
2023-06-08,"Maybe the exercises during the day could contain ""optional"" parts for those who have completed the exercise without issues. There is quite a bit of wait time when people a struggling and getting help, and it would be awesome to utilize that time to maybe do something a little more advanced or difficult, for those who are just sitting and waiting. But otherwise, I really enjoyed the hands-on way that we all code together"
2023-06-08,Thank you for all the time and effort that clearly went into this course. See you at the advanced course in November. Best regards Jonas
2023-06-08,Would it be poosible to see an exemple for a full table 1 descriptive statisctis after completing the mmash dataset or is it too time consuming?
2023-06-08,Maybe at the start of day 1 show the unprocessed data and the final tibble we have created today - to show the participants what we are aiming for at the end.
2023-06-08,"It was great and very useful, thank you :)"
2023-06-08,"Thank you for this fantastic course! Not only did I learn incredible much, but I feel like I'm part of a community, where I can network, discuss and ask questions related to Rstudio. I can only recommend this course to all of my colleges. Luk, you will definitely see me at the advanced course. :) Also, can I just say that the food was just so good!"
2023-06-08,"I thought the code of conduct prior to the course felt a bit patronizing. I don't know if you have had issues in previous years, but to me it felt like you don't trust adults to behave properly in public or somehow imply that improper behavior is acceptable in other courses. Rather than creating a relaxed and comfortable environment, I felt that it initially created a more up-tight and on-edge feeling, where you had to figure out whether you could talk to people normally or whether you had to be completely on guard at all times hoping not to commit a social faux pas. Of course everyone on the course was totally cool and everything is completely normal, which is again why I think the inclusion of this official code of conduct is at best redundant and at worst counter productive. Not sure if this is something you were told to include from some higher-up.And again, regarding the course itself, totally perfect. Could not have been better. Compliments to the team. I have already recommended it to several people."
2023-06-08,Really nice course!
