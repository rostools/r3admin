Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"General comment: At day 1, maybe explain what we want to end up with in the end? We have been working with a lot of different documents such as lessons.R and mmash.R, so e.g. we want to end up creating a script in mmsah.R that can load and prepare all of our data for us. We achive this by using the lessons.R document to create and test our functions. :-)"
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Honestly a bit slow, with all the 5 min. breaks for showing post-its for every single line"
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,In general it would be good on the course to have a bit parallel work on your own data eventhough I know it is a bit diffucult to arrange when not everybody do have own data.
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,It worked well
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Mario is a bit to quick at typing compared to me, so I could not follow, besides you might want to change the description for the course""- know a little to a moderate amount of R (or computing in general);- know how to use R and have some familiarity with the tidyverse and RStudio.""Even though I have completed a statistic course where we did everything in R, I can feel that I am not at the same level as the remaining participants."
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Maybe an overall comment: extra tasks or links to other good material (the links to cheat sheets are nice)
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,More of those exercises where you yourself have to complete a piece of code.
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,No comment
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Not sure :-)
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Nothing
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"The coding went a little bit too fast, so it was hard to ""code along"" and I was feeling a little bit ""behind"" all the time - so I would suggest to take down the speed and explain while coding instead of having it ready and then you have to do it yourself afterwards. the session felt a little bit stressingNot related to the session but in general: it would have been nice to have a short description of the dataset, to understand e.g. that day 1 and day 2 in the saliva dataset are coded as night and next morning. so background to the dataset, what is it that we are looking at? and why did we have to summarise the rr dataset? what was it we did here? But otherwise really good :)"

Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,All of it
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"All the sessions so far, has had the same set up. And I think it works well, with coding along, and then trying on your own afterwards. Good pace."
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Exercises and code-alongs. I also like the visual examples in the book!

Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,There was enough time to do the exercises / reading  and for questions
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"This was very good - to me it went a bit slow, but I used sparetime to setup my own project in this folderstructure."
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"almost everything worked, great"

Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,the examples
Day 2,worked well for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,the visual join example made it a lot easier to understand what we were going to do. Exercises and type-alongs

Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,Can't fnd any
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,I can't think of anything
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,"I would have liked to use more time on making great tables, but I could learn it myself now."
Day 3,could be improved for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,I would say it was really good. comment on the last session about what next: I really liked this one .

Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,The figures were really nice
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,all in all a great course. Everything wrapped-up on last day.
Day 3,worked well for the Quickly re-arranging data with pivots,everything :)
