Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,A bit more introduction in the code-along on the overall purpose.
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Again, could increase the pace a bit, as its easy to loose focus throughout the sessions"
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"As mentioned earlier: please, just add more details on the sessions into the program as I felt little lost in exercises. Further, please try to use standard English and be more clear as it was little hard to understand the aim or what is required to perform the tasks."
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,For me the spring cleaning and importing data again went too fast
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Going a little more into why we separate the Rmd and script file
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"It helps seeing the overall workflow but perhaps more words on why its done like that, why deleting everything  and  using mmash and not lesson"
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,It was good
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Maybe a recap at the end of the day of the two days.
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Maybe an exercise were you have to think about which join you should make
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Maybe just start the day with spending 10 min to repeat what we learned yesterday
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,More time
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Not specifically for this session but I forgot to add to day 1 that it would be nice to see how to import multiple csv files to project folder (and not just from the link)..
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"Some tools used (eg. regex) feels rather advanced (I could probably not apply it on my own data without help). Nice to have the concept explained, but is there a simpler way of doing the task solved by the regex that could have been applied?"
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,The answer is the same. Less basic about coding and more on how to project manage in R.
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,Things felt a little rushed at the end.
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,no idea
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,nothing
Day 2,could be improved for the Processing and joining datasets for cleaning,"same issue, I suggest to reduce same practice or reduce time."
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","I could use a shorten overview of what we have done. Like 1) Make a function to import data, 2) make a function that import multiple files, 3) import datasets, 4) make a function that extract user_id, 5) join dataset...."
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",I would like to also practise creating functions with more data analysis related issues and not just importing - in order to apply it more to my own projects.
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","I would like to suggest to reduce the similar practice, I feel it is not very necessary to use same method work on different datasets."
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",If first introducing the session and then perform the exercise
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","It was hard to follow. There was a lot of going back and forth between programs and there if you fell behind it was difficult to catch up. So better structure and slower, please:)"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","It was really really slow - a lot of repetition of the same exercises, which in general is useful, but in my opinion was quite elongated this time - an exercise that was 'assigned' 15 min extended to 45 min and then additional 30 min to go through it on the screen, and then after lunch repeat some of it again"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","More excersises where you need to ""think"" more and solve a question that is not only repetation"
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",More time
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",More time could have been spent on introduction to the tidyverse operators. Also the code-alongs went a little too fast in this section.
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","Online, there was a good description of the difference between loops and map, but the presentation of it was not very clear"

Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals",nothing
Day 2,"could be improved for the Save time, don’t repeat yourself: Using functionals","please, just add more details on the sessions into the program as I felt little lost in exercises.
